In unanesthetized , spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine , 5 to 20 micrograms / kg , was inhibited or reversed by nalozone , 0 . 2 to 2 mg / kg . The hypotensive effect of 100 mg / kg alpha - methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone . Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate . In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 5 ) M , did not influence stereoselective binding of [ 3H ] - naloxone ( 8 nM ) , and naloxone , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 4 ) M , did not influence clonidine - suppressible binding of [ 3H ] - dihydroergocryptine ( 1 nM ) . These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha - adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors . As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site , the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha - methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone ."}

Rats with lithium - induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein ( HP ) feeding , uninephrectomy ( NX ) or a combination of these , in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure . Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium - containing diet ( 50 mmol / kg ) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet , HP diet ( 40 vs . 19 % ) , NX or HP + NX for another 8 weeks . Corresponding non - lithium pretreated groups were generated . When comparing all lithium treated versus non - lithium - treated groups , lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules ) or lithium clearance . Consequently , lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion . Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis . HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats . NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which , however , was ameliorated by HP . NX + HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li - pretreated rats . The results indicate that Li - induced nephropathy , even when the GFR is only modestly reduced , is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension . In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow , which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli . The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced , leaving the distal delivery unchanged . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )"}

Eight Crohn ' s disease patients were included . Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t . d . s . and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks .

Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid ( and tranexamic acid ) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man . Injection of Captopril ( 1 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) , reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model . The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme - blocking agent . The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed , indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein . Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril . The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and and tranexamic acid alone . It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin ) . Captopril may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli , with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced ."}

A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic Carbamazepine treatment on folate concentrations in the rat . In the course of developing this model , a common vehicle , propylene glycol , by itself in high doses , was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain . Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether ( hexafluorodiethyl ether ) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by Carbamazepine than seizures induced by maximal electroshock ( MES ) . Oral administration of Carbamazepine as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg / kg was continuously protective against hexafluorodiethyl ether - induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment . The Carbamazepine levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals , however , were below those normally considered protective .

The multiple drug schema consisted of : Etoposide 16 . 213 , Methotrexate , Cyclophosphamide , Actomycin - D , and Cisplatin . On the first day of the schedule , moderate high doses of Methotrexate , Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered . Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs , probably originating from the uterus . Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins , which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces ; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli . In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations , such as spontaneous necrosis , must be considered less likely . Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are , according to existing classifications , at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance . Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment , especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug .

Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36 - 40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance : about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic ( A group ) . The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped ( S ) licking and / or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic ( K ) behaviour ( AS / KS group ) , suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation .

Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group . However , the level in the AS / KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group . The results suggest that rigidity , which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum , can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum . Nevertheless , there occurs some real tolerance to this effect .

However , coniine has failed to produce arthrogryposis in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits . The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of coniine and nicotine in the developing chick . Concentrations of coniine and nicotine sulfate were 0 . 015 % , 0 . 03 % , 0 . 075 % , 0 . 15 % , 0 . 75 % , 1 . 5 % , 3 % , and 6 % and 1 % , 5 % , and 10 % , respectively . Both compounds caused deformations and lethality in a dose - dependent manner . All concentrations of nicotine sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for coniine lethality was 0 . 75 % . The deformations caused by both coniine and nicotine sulfate were excessive flexion or extension of one or more toes . No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group ; however , extensive cranial hemorrhage occurred in all nicotine sulfate - treated chicks .

Oncopaz Cooperative Group . BACKGROUND : Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ) is high among elderly patients , few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients . Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine ( vinorelbine ) or gemcitabine ( gemcitabine ) may obtain a response rate of 20 - 30 % in elderly patients , with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life . In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbine in elderly patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed . METHODS : Forty - nine patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma were included , 38 of whom were age > / = 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin . All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity . Treatment was comprised of vinorelbine , 25 mg / m ( 2 ) , plus gemcitabine , 1000 mg / m ( 2 ) , both on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 every 28 days . Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected . RESULTS : One hundred sixty - five courses were administered , with a median of 3 . 6 courses per patient . The overall response rate was 26 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 15 - 41 % ) . Two patients attained a complete response ( 4 % ) and 11 patients ( 22 % ) achieved a partial response . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35 % of those patients with an initial value > 0 , whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients ( 55 % ) . The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1 - year survival rate was 33 % . Toxicity was mild . Six patients ( 12 % ) had World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia , 2 patients ( 4 % ) had Grade 3 - 4 thrombocytopenia , and 2 patients ( 4 % ) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity .

{"document_id": "10669626", "title": "10669626", "text": "Warfarin - induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin D . The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma - carboxylation of matrix Gla protein , a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall . The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin - treated rats . Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20 - day - old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42 - day - old rats . In contrast , no artery calcification could be detected in 10 - month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment . To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin - induced artery calcification in animals of the same age , 20 - day - old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 - g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth . Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited group . Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30 % higher levels of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin - induced artery calcification , ie , the 10 - month - old rats and the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited young rats . This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin - induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels . The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification . High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days . High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week . In the current study , we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D - treated rats at 3 and 4 days . There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium , which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium . Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D , the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor . High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma - carboxylated . These observations indicate that although the gamma - carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor , they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites ."}

METHOD : The response of 44 patients meeting DSM - IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech - Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale . Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age , sex , diagnosis ( DSM - IV bipolar I vs . bipolar II ) , number of previous manic episodes , type of antidepressant therapy used ( electroconvulsive therapy vs . antidepressant drugs and , more particularly , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ] ) , use and type of mood stabilizers ( lithium vs . anticonvulsants ) , and temperament of the patient , assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi - structured Affective Temperament Interview . RESULTS : Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27 % of all patients ( N = 12 ) ( and in 24 % of the subgroup of patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ 8 / 33 ] ) ; 16 % ( N = 7 ) experienced manic episodes , and 11 % ( N = 5 ) experienced hypomanic episodes . Sex , age , diagnosis ( bipolar I vs . bipolar II ) , and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching . The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer . In contrast , mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium ( 15 % , 4 / 26 ) than in patients not treated with lithium ( 44 % , 8 / 18 ; p = . 04 ) . The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching , whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching ( p = . 008 ) . CONCLUSION : The frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment . Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament , who have a greater risk of mood switches ."}

We investigated this association , according to the type of progestagen included in third - generation ( i . e . , desogestrel or gestodene ) and second - generation ( i . e . , levonorgestrel ) oral contraceptives , the dose of estrogen , and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS : In a nationwide , population - based , case - control study , we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first myocardial infarction between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a myocardial infarction and who were matched for age , calendar year of the index event , and area of residence . Subjects supplied information on oral - contraceptive use and major cardiovascular risk factors . An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS : The odds ratio for myocardial infarction among women who used any type of combined oral contraceptive , as compared with nonusers , was 2 . 0 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 2 . 8 ) . The adjusted odds ratio was 2 . 5 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 4 . 1 ) among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives and 1 . 3 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 7 to 2 . 5 ) among those who used third - generation oral contraceptives . Among women who used oral contraceptives , the odds ratio was 2 . 1 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 ) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1 . 9 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 6 to 5 . 5 ) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS : The risk of myocardial infarction was increased among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives . The results with respect to the use of third - generation oral contraceptives were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second - generation oral contraceptives . The risk of myocardial infarction was similar among women who used oral contraceptives whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation ."}

The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens ( the shell and the core ) on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by cocaine in rats . Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core , and then were locally injected with GR 55562 ( an antagonist of 5 - HT1B receptors ) or CP 93129 ( an agonist of 5 - HT1B receptors ) . Given alone to any accumbal subregion , GR 55562 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) or CP 93129 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) did not change basal locomotor activity . Systemic cocaine ( 10 mg / kg ) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats . GR 55562 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) , administered intra - accumbens shell prior to cocaine , dose - dependently attenuated the psychostimulant - induced locomotor hyperactivity . Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with GR 55562 into the accumbens core . When injected into the accumbens shell ( but not the core ) before cocaine , CP 93129 ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) enhanced the locomotor response to cocaine ; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg / side of the agonist . The later enhancement was attenuated after intra - accumbens shell treatment with GR 55562 ( 1 microg / side ) . Our findings indicate that cocaine induced hyperlocomotion is modified by 5 - HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell , but not core , this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5 - HT1B receptor antagonist ( GR 55562 ) and agonist ( CP 93129 ) , respectively . In other words , the present results suggest that the accumbal shell 5 - HT1B receptors play a permissive role in the behavioural response to the psychostimulant ."}

OBJECTIVE : To report 2 cases of ticlopidine - induced cholestatic hepatitis , investigate its mechanism , and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases . CASE SUMMARIES : Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty , with complete remission during the follow - up period . T - cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ticlopidine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients , but not in healthy controls . DISCUSSION : Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine ; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature . Our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ticlopidine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis , which resolved after discontinuation of the drug . Hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course , but complete remission was observed in all reported cases . An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of ticlopidine . The mechanisms of this ticlopidine - induced cholestasis are unclear . Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug ' s hepatotoxicity , as suggested by the T - cell stimulation study reported here . CONCLUSIONS : Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of ticlopidine that may be immune mediated . Patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell counts . This complication will be observed even less often in the future as ticlopidine is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent clopidogrel ."}

In experimental nephrotic syndrome , urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease . The molecular mechanism ( s ) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated . The rate - limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) . We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside ( puromycin aminonucleoside ) - induced nephrotic syndrome . The time courses of urinary sodium excretion , plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either puromycin aminonucleoside or vehicle . The relative amounts of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real - time quantitative TaqMan PCR , and the amounts of proteins by Western blot . The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously . Sodium retention occurred on days 2 , 3 and 6 after puromycin aminonucleoside injection . A significant up - regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3 . Conversely , down - regulation of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations , and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values . The amounts of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during puromycin aminonucleoside - induced sodium retention . In conclusion , ENaC mRNA expression , especially alphaENaC , is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome in rats , but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3 ."}

The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide ( calcitonin gene - related peptide ) concentration and platelet serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytriptamine , 5 - HT ) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin . Fifteen female migraineurs ( without aura ) and eight controls participated in the study . Sublingual nitroglycerin ( 0 . 5 mg ) was administered . Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times : 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application , and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack ( mean 344 and 404 min ; 12 subjects ) . In those subjects who had no migraine attack ( 11 subjects ) a similar time schedule was used . Plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide concentration increased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine . In addition , both change and peak , showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity ( P < 0 . 001 ) . However , plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack . Basal calcitonin gene - related peptide concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5 - HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack . Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack . In conclusion , the fact that plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between calcitonin gene - related peptide and migraine . In contrast , serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine , it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant calcitonin gene - related peptide release in this model ."}

Urotensin - II ( Urotensin - II ) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system . Intracerebroventricular ( i . c . v . ) injection of Urotensin - II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion . However , the behavioral effects of centrally administered Urotensin - II have received little attention . In the present study , we tested the effects of i . c . v . injections of Urotensin - II on behavioral , metabolic , and endocrine responses in mice . Administration of graded doses of Urotensin - II ( 1 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse ) provoked : ( 1 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole - board test ; ( 2 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black - and - white compartment test , and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus - maze test ; and ( 3 ) a dose - dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced - swimming test and tail suspension test . Intracerebroventricular injection of Urotensin - II also caused an increase in : food intake at doses of 100 and 1 , 000 ng / mouse , water intake at doses of 100 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse , and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10 , 000 ng / mouse . Whatever was the dose , the central administration of Urotensin - II had no effect on body temperature , nociception , apomorphine - induced penile erection and climbing behavior , and stress - induced plasma corticosterone level . Taken together , the present study demonstrates that the central injection of Urotensin - II at doses of 1 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse induces anxiogenic - and depressant - like effects in mouse . These data suggest that Urotensin - II may be involved in some aspects of psychiatric disorders ."}

We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection . The donor was a 40 - year - old female , first - time apheresis platelet donor . Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and depression . Reported medications included bumetanide , pravastatin , and paroxetine . Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure , the donor noted tingling around the mouth , hands , and feet . She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany . Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated , and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes . The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia . Upon additional retrospective analysis , it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia . We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity . Laboratory measurement of pre - procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance . The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors ."}

In cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in the rat , detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered . Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated . Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide - pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic , adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists . Generally , atropine reduced contractions , but in contrast to controls , it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity ( 1 - 5 Hz ) in inflamed preparations . In both types , purinoceptor desensitization with alpha , beta - methylene adenosine - 5 ' - triphosphate ( alpha , beta - meATP ) caused further reductions at low frequencies ( < 10 Hz ) . The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine , 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine ( 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine ) ( ' M ( 1 ) / M ( 3 ) / M ( 5 ) - selective ' ) , methoctramine ( ' M ( 2 ) - selective ' ) and pirenzepine ( ' M ( 1 ) - selective ' ) antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component . 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine . In inflamed preparations , the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls . In contrast to controls , methoctramine increased - - instead of decreased - - the tonic responses at high frequencies .

OBJECTIVE : To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs ( BZDs / RDs ) and health , functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly . METHODS : A non - randomised clinical study of patients aged > or = 65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month . 164 patients ( mean age + / - standard deviation [ SD ] 81 . 6 + / - 6 . 8 years ) were admitted . Of these , nearly half ( n = 78 ) had used BZDs / RDs before admission , and the remainder ( n = 86 ) were non - users . Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) . Patients scoring > or = 20 MMSE sum points were interviewed ( n = 79 ) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission . Data on use of BZDs / RDs before admission , current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records . Health , physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD / RD users and non - users , and adjustments were made for confounding variables . The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam , temazepam and zopiclone were analysed . RESULTS : The mean + / - SD duration of BZD / RD use was 7 + / - 7 years ( range 1 - 31 ) . Two or three BZDs / RDs were concomitantly taken by 26 % of users ( n = 20 ) . Long - term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS , which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia . After adjustment for these variables as confounders , use of BZDs / RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE . However , use of BZDs / RDs was associated with dizziness , inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay . Use of BZDs / RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night - time sleep during the week prior to admission . A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables . CONCLUSIONS : Long - term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD / RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses . Long - term use was associated with daytime and night - time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs ."}

PATIENTS AND METHODS : Patients with more than 50 % decrease in platelet count or thrombocytopenia ( < 150 x 10 ( 9 ) / L ) after exposure to heparin , who had a positive two - step antigen assay [ optical density ( OD ) > 0 . 4 and > 50 inhibition with high concentration of heparin ] were included in the study . RESULTS : Forty of 94 heparin - induced thrombocytopenia patients had thrombosis at diagnosis ; 54 / 94 had isolated - heparin - induced thrombocytopenia without thrombosis . Eight of the isolated - heparin - induced thrombocytopenia patients developed thrombosis within the next 30 d ; thus , a total of 48 patients had thrombosis at day 30 . At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between heparin - induced thrombocytopenia patients with thrombosis and those with isolated - heparin - induced thrombocytopenia . However , OD was significantly higher in all patients with thrombosis ( n = 48 , 1 . 34 + / - 0 . 89 ) , including isolated - heparin - induced thrombocytopenia patients who later developed thrombosis within 30 d ( n = 8 , 1 . 84 + / - 0 . 64 ) as compared to isolated - heparin - induced thrombocytopenia patients who did not develop thrombosis ( 0 . 96 + / - 0 . 75 ; P = 0 . 011 and P = 0 . 008 ) .

BACKGROUND : Direct thrombin inhibitors ( DTIs ) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ) or heparin - induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis ( heparin - induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis ) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . In the following report , a 65 - year - old critically ill patient with a suspected history of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation . The patient required massive transfusion support ( 55 units of red blood cells , 42 units of fresh - frozen plasma , 40 units of cryoprecipitate , 40 units of platelets , and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa ) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding . STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for argatroban concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time ( ECT ) assay . RESULTS : Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples ( range , 0 - 32 microg / mL ) , and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life ( t ( 1 / 2 ) ) of 514 minutes was observed ( published elimination t ( 1 / 2 ) is 39 - 51 minutes [ < or = 181 minutes with hepatic impairment ] ) . CONCLUSIONS : Correlation of plasma argatroban concentration versus the patient ' s coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma argatroban may have contributed to the patient ' s extended coagulopathy . Because DTIs do not have reversal agents , surgical teams and transfusion services should remain aware of the possibility of massive transfusion events during anticoagulation with these agents . This is the first report to measure plasma argatroban concentration in the context of CPB and extended coagulopathy ."}

At presentation , advanced encephalopathy and cerebral edema were present in 51 ( 76 % ) and 29 ( 41 . 4 % ) patients , respectively . Gastrointestinal bleed , seizures , infection , and acute renal failure were documented in seven ( 10 % ) , five ( 7 . 1 % ) , 26 ( 37 . 1 % ) , and seven ( 10 % ) patients , respectively . Compared with hepatitis E virus ( HEV ) and non - A non - E - induced ALF , ATT - ALF patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes . The mortality rate among patients with ATT - ALF was high ( 67 . 1 % , n = 47 ) , and only 23 ( 32 . 9 % ) patients recovered with medical treatment . In multivariate analysis , three factors independently predicted mortality : serum bilirubin ( > or = 10 . 8 mg / dL ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) prolongation ( > or = 26 seconds ) , and grade III / IV encephalopathy at presentation . CONCLUSION : ATT - ALF constituted 5 . 7 % of ALF at our center and had a high mortality rate . Because the mortality rate is so high , determining which factors are predictors is less important . A high proportion of patients had consumed ATT empirically , which could have been prevented ."}

OBJECTIVE : The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation . Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum , and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects . The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol - induced parkinsonian symptoms . METHODS : Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study . RESULTS : Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol - induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats . Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration . The neurotensin type - 1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin . CONCLUSION : Activation of pallidal neurotensin receptors may be involved in neurotensin - induced antiparkinsonian effects ."}

The effects of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt ( QS / QT ) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40 - 50 per cent . Before nitroprusside infusion , 5 cm H2O CPAP significantly , P less than . 05 , decreased arterial blood pressure , but did not significantly alter heart rate , cardiac output , systemic vascular resistance , or QS / QT . Ten cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and QS / QT . Nitroprusside caused significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate , but did not change cardiac output or QS / QT . Five cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside did not further alter any of the above - mentioned variables . However , 10 cm H2O CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure , cardiac output , and QS / QT . These data indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40 - 50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS / QT .

Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute myocardial infarction . In individuals with preexisting , high - grade coronary arterial narrowing , acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine - induced increase in rate - pressure product . In other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction , coronary occlusion may be due to spasm , thrombus , or both . With regard to spasm , the clinical findings are largely circumstantial , and the locus of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction remains speculative . Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial , medium - size vessels , other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction . Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental , discrete infarction . Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha - mediated , other in vitro data suggest the opposite . The finding of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction in segments of ( noninnervated ) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha - mediated effects . Finally , the contribution of a primary , thrombotic effect of cocaine has not been excluded ."}

The systolic pressure variation ( SPV ) , which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) after one positive - pressure breath , was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension . Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage ( hemorrhage , n = 7 ) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside ( sodium nitroprusside , n = 7 ) . During hemorrhage - induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the sodium nitroprusside group . The systemic , central venous , pulmonary capillary wedge pressures , and heart rates , were similar in the two groups . Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups . The SPV during hypotension was 15 . 7 + / - 6 . 7 mm Hg in the hemorrhage group , compared with 9 . 1 + / - 2 . 0 mm Hg in the sodium nitroprusside group ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .

CASE SUMMARY : A 13 - year - old boy was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin because of suspected septicemia . Medications were discontinued when erythema multiforme and congestive heart failure caused by myocarditis occurred . The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and gradually improved . Macrophage - migration inhibition ( MIF ) test with ampicillin was positive . DISCUSSION : After most infections causing erythema multiforme and myocarditis were ruled out , a drug - induced allergic reaction was suspected . Positive MIF test for ampicillin showed sensitization of the patient ' s lymphocytes to ampicillin . CONCLUSIONS : Hypersensitivity myocarditis is a rare and dangerous manifestation of allergy to penicillins ."}

A large group of patients with suspected allergic reactions to beta - lactam antibiotics was evaluated . A detailed clinical history , together with skin tests , RAST ( radioallergosorbent test ) , and controlled challenge tests , was used to establish whether patients allergic to beta - lactam antibiotics had selective immediate allergic responses to amoxicillin ( amoxicillin ) or were cross - reacting with other penicillin derivatives . Skin tests were performed with benzylpenicilloyl - poly - L - lysine ( benzylpenicilloyl - poly - L - lysine ) , benzylpenicilloate , benzylpenicillin ( PG ) , ampicillin ( ampicillin ) , and amoxicillin . RAST for benzylpenicilloyl - poly - L - lysine and amoxicillin - PLL was done . When both skin test and RAST for BPO were negative , single - blind , placebo - controlled challenge tests were done to ensure tolerance of PG or sensitivity to amoxicillin . A total of 177 patients were diagnosed as allergic to beta - lactam antibiotics . We selected the 54 ( 30 . 5 % ) cases of immediate amoxicillin allergy with good tolerance of PG . Anaphylaxis was seen in 37 patients ( 69 % ) , the other 17 ( 31 % ) having urticaria and / or angioedema . All the patients were skin test negative to BPO ; 49 of 51 ( 96 % ) were also negative to MDM , and 44 of 46 ( 96 % ) to PG . Skin tests with amoxicillin were positive in 34 ( 63 % ) patients . RAST was positive for amoxicillin in 22 patients ( 41 % ) and to BPO in just 5 ( 9 % ) . None of the sera with negative RAST for amoxicillin were positive to BPO . Challenge tests with amoxicillin were performed in 23 subjects ( 43 % ) to establish the diagnosis of immediate allergic reaction to amoxicillin , and in 15 cases ( 28 % ) both skin test and RAST for amoxicillin were negative . PG was well tolerated by all 54 patients . We describe the largest group of amoxicillin - allergic patients who have tolerated PG reported so far . Diagnosis of these patients can be achieved only if specific amoxicillin - related reagents are employed . Further studies are necessary to determine the exact extent of this problem and to improve the efficacy of diagnostic methods ."}

Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end - stage renal disease ( end - stage renal disease ) , with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19 . As a result of these and other studies , phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries . However , three case control studies , one each in North Carolina , northern Maryland , and West Berlin , Germany , showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and end - stage renal disease , with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4 . These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of end - stage renal disease , with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former . This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves . A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone . Thus , acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics , whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations . The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of end - stage renal disease has not been clearly demonstrated , but cannot be dismissed ."}

Heparan sulphate - associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin and in age - adn sex - matched control rats , employing the cationic dye cuprolinic blue . Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor . The heparan sulphate specificity of the cuprolinic blue staining was demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan - degrading enzymes , showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining , whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect . The majority of anionic sites ( 74 % in diabetic and 81 % in control rats ) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane . A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna , and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane ( p < 0 . 001 and p < 0 . 01 for diabetic and control rats , respectively ) . Diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40 . 3 ( 32 . 2 - 62 . 0 ) mg / 24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals ( 0 . 8 ( 0 . 2 - 0 . 9 ) mg / 24 h , p < 0 . 002 ) . At the same time , the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface ( number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface ) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19 % ( p < 0 . 021 ) and by 26 % ( p < 0 . 02 ) , respectively . Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane ( lamina densa and lamina rara interna ) were not significantly changed . We conclude that in streptozotocin - diabetic rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion , a reduced heparan sulphate charge barrier / density is found at the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane ."}

The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism ( venous thromboembolism ) associated with newer oral contraceptives ( oral contraceptives ) did not distinguish between patterns of oral contraceptives use , namely first - time users , repeaters and switchers . Data from a Transnational case - control study were used to assess the risk of venous thromboembolism for the latter patterns of use , while accounting for duration of use . Over the period 1993 - 1996 , 551 cases of venous thromboembolism were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls . Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns . The adjusted rate ratio of venous thromboembolism for repeat users of third generation oral contraceptives was 0 . 6 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 3 - 1 . 2 ) relative to repeat users of second generation pills , whereas it was 1 . 3 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 7 - 2 . 4 ) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills . We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of venous thromboembolism when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills . These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer oral contraceptives in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use ."}

BACKGROUND : An association has been found between transplant glomerulopathy ( transplant glomerulopathy ) and reduplication of peritubular capillary basement membranes ( PTCR ) . Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance , only one prospective study has tried to confirm it . METHODS : We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens ( from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys ) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR . In addition to renal allografts with transplant glomerulopathy , we also examined grafts with acute rejection , recurrent glomerulonephritis , chronic allograft nephropathy and stable grafts ( \" protocol biopsies \" ) . Native kidney specimens included a wide range of glomerulopathies as well as cases of thrombotic microangiopathy , malignant hypertension , acute interstitial nephritis , and acute tubular necrosis . RESULTS : We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of transplant glomerulopathy , in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without transplant glomerulopathy , and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens . These 13 included cases of malignant hypertension , thrombotic microangiopathy , lupus nephritis , Henoch - Schonlein nephritis , crescentic glomerulonephritis , and cocaine - related acute renal failure . Mild PTCR in allografts without transplant glomerulopathy did not predict renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow - up periods of between 3 months and 1 year . CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that in transplants , there is a strong association between well - developed PTCR and transplant glomerulopathy , while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of transplant glomerulopathy is unclear . PTCR also occurs in certain native kidney diseases , though the association is not as strong as that for transplant glomerulopathy .

Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors . The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine , opioid , GABA ( A ) and NMDA receptors . In behavioral studies , pre - treatment of mice with BD1018 , BD1063 , or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine - induced convulsions and lethality . Moreover , post - treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine - induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals . In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists , the well - characterized sigma receptor agonist di - o - tolylguanidine ( di - o - tolylguanidine ) and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 ( 3R - 1 - [ 2 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 4 . 3 . 0 ] nonane ) each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine .

To further validate the hypothesis that the anti - cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors , an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine . Together , the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of cocaine - induced behaviors ."}

Torsades de pointes is a side - effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market ( e . g . terfenadine and terodiline ) . 2 . The potential of compounds to cause Torsades de pointes was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog . Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause Torsades de pointes were investigated : terfenadine , terodiline , cisapride and E4031 . On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target , free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures in man . Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target - free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds . 3 . These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for terfenadine ( 1 . 9 nM ) , terodiline ( 76 nM ) , cisapride ( 11 nM ) and E4031 ( 1 . 9 nM ) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects . For compounds that have shown Torsades de pointes in the clinic ( terfenadine , terodiline , cisapride ) there is little differentiation between the dog ED50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations in man ( < 10 - fold ) reflecting their limited safety margins .

METHODS : We conducted a prospective , randomized , double - blind study in the emergency department of a central - city teaching hospital . Patients aged 18 years or older treated with prochlorperazine for headache , nausea , or vomiting were eligible for inclusion . Study participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of prochlorperazine administered intravenously by means of 2 - minute push ( bolus group ) or 10 mg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline solution administered by means of intravenous infusion during a 15 - minute period ( infusion group ) . The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing akathisia within 60 minutes of administration . Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or agitation or a change of 2 or more in the patient - reported akathisia rating scale and a change of at least 1 in the investigator - observed akathisia rating scale . The intensity of headache and nausea was measured with a 100 - mm visual analog scale . RESULTS : One hundred patients were enrolled . One study participant was excluded after protocol violation . Seventy - three percent ( 73 / 99 ) of the study participants were treated for headache and 70 % ( 70 / 99 ) for nausea . In the bolus group , 26 . 0 % ( 13 / 50 ) had akathisia compared with 32 . 7 % ( 16 / 49 ) in the infusion group ( Delta = - 6 . 7 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] - 24 . 6 % to 11 . 2 % ) .

BACKGROUND : The septo - hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis , and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents , but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal severity . Thus , the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity . METHODS : Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol - na ve Withdrawal Seizure - Prone ( WSP ) and - Resistant ( WSR ) mice . Animals were administered nicotine , carbachol , or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion , and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose . We also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium - stimulated acetylcholine ( acetylcholine ) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus . Potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice , separated by 75 min . Hippocampal acetylcholine also was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions . RESULTS : Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine , carbachol , and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice . In microdialysis experiments , the lines did not differ in basal release of acetylcholine , and 50 mM KCl increased acetylcholine output in both lines of mice . However , the increase in release of acetylcholine produced by the first application of KCl was 2 - fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice . When hippocampal acetylcholine was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions , extracellular acetylcholine was significantly elevated ( 192 % ) in WSP mice , but was nonsignificantly elevated ( 59 % ) in WSR mice . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal . Specifically , WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons ."}

METHODS : Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case - control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne , hirsutism or polycystic ovary syndrome to estimate the risk of venous thromboembolism associated with CPA / EE . RESULTS : The age - adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA / EE versus conventional COCs was 2 . 20 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1 . 35 - 3 . 58 ] . Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception , had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms , the case - control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ( adj ) ) of 7 . 44 ( 95 % CI 3 . 67 - 15 . 08 ) for CPA / EE use compared with an OR ( adj ) of 2 . 58 ( 95 % CI 1 . 60 - 4 . 18 ) for use of conventional COCs . CONCLUSIONS : We have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism associated with the use of CPA / EE in women with acne , hirsutism or polycystic ovary syndrome although residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded ."}

PATIENTS AND METHODS : Forty - two patients with biopsy - proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [ 26 with stage C ( T3N0M0 ) and 16 with stage D1 ( T3N1M0 ) ] were included in this study . All patients received CAB [ leuprolide acetate ( LHRH - A ) 3 . 75 mg , intramuscularly , every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide , tid , per Os ] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals ( 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 months post - CAB ) . Hb , PSA and Testosterone measurements were recorded . Patients with stage D2 - 3 disease , abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study . The duration of the study was six months . RESULTS : The mean hemoglobin ( Hb ) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14 . 2 g / dl to 14 . 0 g / dl , 13 . 5 g / dl , 13 . 2 g / dl and 12 . 7 g / dl at 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 months post - CAB , respectively . Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb < 11 g / dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients ( 14 . 3 % ) . This CAB - induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic . At six months post - CAB , patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10 . 2 + / - 0 . 1 g / dl ( X + / - SE ) , whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13 . 2 + / - 0 . 17 ( X + / - SE ) . The development of severe anemia at 6 months post - CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2 . 5 g / dl after 3 months of CAB ( p = 0 . 01 ) . The development of severe CAB - induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values ( T < 3 ng / ml versus T > or = 3 ng / ml ) , with age ( < 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs ) , and clinical stage ( stage C versus stage D1 ) .

We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine ( mixed alpha2 - / I1 - receptor agonist ) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction . The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2 - and / or I1 - receptors . Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine ( 600 microg / kg ) or alpha - methyldopa ( 100 mg / kg ) , selective I1 - and alpha2 - receptor agonists , respectively , in blood pressure , hemodynamic variability , and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham - operated and ovariectomized ( Ovx ) Sprague - Dawley female rats with or without 12 - wk estrogen replacement . Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed : the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat - to - beat intervals ( SDRR ) and the root mean square of successive differences in R - wave - to - R - wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability . In sham - operated rats , rilmenidine or alpha - methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure . SDRR was reduced only by alpha - methyldopa . Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha - methyldopa , in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension . The enhanced alpha - methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity . Estrogen replacement ( 17beta - estradiol subcutaneous pellet , 14 . 2 microg / day , 12 wk ) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha - methyldopa to sham - operated levels . These findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2 - but not I1 - receptor - mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha - methyldopa - estrogen interaction ."}

Sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor - containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase . Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy . Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis , autoimmunity , cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation . Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors , it has been designated a ' non - nephrotoxic drug ' . However , clinical reports suggest that , under some circumstances , sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction . A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre - existing chronic renal damage . The mechanisms of sirolimus - associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal . It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury , but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive . The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus ( such as in delayed graft function ) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair processes . Although these adverse effects occur in some patients , their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney , the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations , close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function , use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed . Further long - term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future ."}

BACKGROUND : Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease , including arrhythmia , coronary heart disease , and chronic heart failure . Activation of presynaptic alpha2 - adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine ; however , other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine . METHODS AND RESULTS : To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2 - adrenoceptors , we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2 - adrenoceptor subtypes ( alpha2ABC - / - ) . Alpha2ABC - / - mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine ; however , clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC - / - mice by up to 150 bpm . Clonidine - induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC - / - mice was 32 . 3 % ( 10 microg / kg ) and 26 . 6 % ( 100 microg / kg ) of the effect in wild - type mice . A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC - knockout and wild - type mice . Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current ( I ( f ) ) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I ( f ) - generating hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - gated ( HCN ) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells . As a consequence of blocking I ( f ) , clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild - type and alpha2ABC - knockout mice . CONCLUSIONS : Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene - targeted mice in vivo , and thus , clonidine - like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors ."}

Does smoking during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns ? OBJECTIVE : Maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth . The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated , although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults . The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions ( TEOAEs ) of healthy neonates . METHODS : This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns . Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy ( n = 200 ears ) were compared to a control group of newborns ( n = 200 ears ) , whose mothers were non - smokers . Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low ( < 5 cigarettes per day , n = 88 ears ) , moderate ( 5 < or = cigarettes per day < 10 , n = 76 ) or high ( > or = 10 cigarettes per day , n = 36 ) . RESULTS : In exposed neonates , TEOAEs mean response ( across frequency ) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non - exposed neonates . Comparisons between exposed newborns ' subgroups revealed no significant differences . However , by comparing each subgroup to control group , we found statistically significant decreases of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups . Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group . CONCLUSION : In utero , exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells . These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns , regardless of the degree of exposure . Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate ' s hearing acuity ."}

Terbutaline , a beta2 - adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor , has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins . We studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats . Newborn rats were given terbutaline ( 10 mg / kg ) daily on postnatal days ( PN ) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30 . Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex , as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter . None of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on PN 11 to 14 . In behavioral tests , animals treated with terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper - reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field , as well as in the acoustic startle response test .

BACKGROUND : Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties . While the mechanisms underlying cocaine ' s rewarding effects have been studied extensively , less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine , such as anxiety . METHODS : In this study , we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta - hydroxylase knockout ( Dbh - / - ) mice , which lack norepinephrine ( norepinephrine ) , in the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine - induced anxiety . RESULTS : We found that cocaine dose - dependently increased anxiety - like behavior in control ( Dbh + / - ) mice , as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration . The Dbh - / - mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine . Cocaine - induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh + / - mice following administration of disulfiram , a dopamine beta - hydroxylase ( DBH ) inhibitor . In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists , we found that pretreatment with the beta - adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine - induced anxiety - like behavior in Dbh + / - and wild - type C57BL6 / J mice , while the alpha ( 1 ) antagonist prazosin and the alpha ( 2 ) antagonist yohimbine had no effect . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta - adrenergic receptors is required for cocaine - induced anxiety in mice ."}

OBJECTIVE : To examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or with methylphenidate in children with attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ) . METHOD : In a 16 - week multicenter , double - blind trial , 122 children with attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder were randomly assigned to clonidine ( n = 31 ) , methylphenidate ( n = 29 ) , clonidine and methylphenidate ( n = 32 ) , or placebo ( n = 30 ) . Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0 . 6 mg / day for clonidine and 60 mg / day for methylphenidate ( both with divided dosing ) . Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs . RESULTS : There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine ( 17 . 5 % versus 3 . 4 % ; p = . 02 ) , but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes . There were no suggestions of interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes .

Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission . However , the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N - methyl - D - aspartate ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) receptor produce schizophrenic - like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor . As a result , there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor . Among them are glycine transporter - 1 ( GlyT1 ) inhibitors such as SSR103800 , which indirectly enhance N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor function by increasing the glycine ( a co - agonist for the N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor ) levels in the synapse . This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic - like properties of SSR103800 , with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity , involving either drug challenge ( ie , amphetamine and MK - 801 ) or transgenic mice ( ie , N - methyl - D - aspartate Nr1 ( neo - / - ) and DAT ( - / - ) ) . Results showed that SSR103800 ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non - competitive N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist , MK - 801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of N - methyl - D - aspartate Nr1 ( neo - / - ) mice . In contrast , SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter ( DAT ( - / - ) ) knockout mice ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) . Importantly , both classical ( haloperidol ) and atypical ( olanzapine , clozapine and aripiprazole ) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity . However , unlike these latter , SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy ( retention on the bar test ) up to 30 mg / kg p . o . Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor , SSR103800 , produces antipsychotic - like effects , which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system , and has a reduced side - effect potential as compared with these latter drugs ."}

BACKGROUND : Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia - induced hypotension . We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ) following anesthesia - induced hypotension . METHODS : Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl ( 0 . 15 mg kg ( - 1 ) ) and propofol ( 2 . 0 mg kg ( - 1 ) ) , 13 patients received phenylephrine ( 0 . 1 mg iv ) and 12 patients received ephedrine ( 10 mg iv ) to restore mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) . Heart rate ( HR ) , MAP , stroke volume ( SV ) , cardiac output ( CO ) , and frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ) were registered . RESULTS : Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP , Heart rate , stroke volume , and cardiac output concomitant with an elevation in S ( c ) O ( 2 ) . After administration of phenylephrine , MAP increased ( 51 + / - 12 to 81 + / - 13 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ; mean + / - SD ) .

BACKGROUND : Current animal models of obsessive - compulsive disorder ( obsessive - compulsive disorder ) typically involve acute , drug - induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety . None of these current models demonstrate multiple obsessive - compulsive disorder - like behaviors . METHODS : Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood . RESULTS : Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety ( elevated plus maze and marble burying ) , behavioral inflexibility ( perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning ) , working memory impairment ( e . g . , win - shift paradigm ) , hoarding , and corticostriatal dysfunction . Dopamine D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum , whereas serotonin 2C , but not serotonin 1A , receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex . CONCLUSIONS : This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an obsessive - compulsive disorder - like profile in animals . Moreover , these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to obsessive - compulsive disorder . This novel model of obsessive - compulsive disorder demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease - like systems permanently , which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders ."}

Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation . In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined . In addition , the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine . Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague - Dawley rats tested in photocell cages . Nicotine ( 1 . 0 mg / kg ) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment , but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment . The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium , indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors . Nicotine - induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390 , the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1 / D2 antagonist fluphenazine . Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine - induced hyperactivity , whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 had no effect . The results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment . The effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors , possibly located on dopaminergic neurons , and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors ."}

Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg / kg per dose , therapy was restarted with lower doses , usually 50 mg / kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality , and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated . Auditory deterioration and improvement , demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine , respectively , provided convincing evidence for a cause - and - effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity . Based on these data , a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine . A dose of 50 mg / kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities . With mild toxicity , a reduction to 30 or 40 mg / kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks . Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg / kg per dose with careful monitoring . In those with symptoms of hearing loss , the drug should be stopped for four weeks , and when the audiogram is stable or improved , therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg / kg per dose . Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction ."}

The correlation between neuropathic damage and inhibition of neurotoxic esterase or neuropathy target enzyme ( NTE ) was examined in rats acutely exposed to Mipafox ( N , N ' - diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate ) , a neurotoxic organophosphate . Brain and spinal cord NTE activities were measured in Long - Evans male rats 1 hr post - exposure to various dosages of Mipafox ( ip , 1 - 15 mg / kg ) . These data were correlated with histologically scored cervical cord damage in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14 - 21 days post - exposure . Those dosages ( greater than or equal to 10 mg / kg ) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73 % and brain greater than or equal to 67 % of control values produced severe ( greater than or equal to 3 ) cervical cord pathology in 85 % of the rats . In contrast , dosages of Mipafox ( less than or equal to 5 mg / kg ) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61 % and brain less than or equal to 60 % produced this degree of cord damage in only 9 % of the animals .

Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute ( 6 or 12 h ) and a subacute ( 3 days ) experiment . 6 h after the administration of amiloride , a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied .

BACKGROUND : Hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( Hydrochlorofluorocarbons ) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for ozone - depleting chlorofluorocarbons ( chlorofluorocarbons ) . Limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds . We investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1 , 1 - dichloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane ( HCFC 123 ) and 1 - chloro - 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 - tetrafluoroethane ( HCFC 124 ) . All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees . Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1 - bromo - 1 - chloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane ( halothane ) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates , which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane . We aimed to test whether Hydrochlorofluorocarbons 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease . METHODS : For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done . The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome - P450 2E1 ( P450 2E1 ) and P58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform ( P58 ) . FINDINGS : The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas ( bridging necrosis ) . Trifluoroacetyl - adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes . Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58 , previously associated with halothane hepatitis , were detected in the serum of five affected workers . INTERPRETATION : Repeated exposure of human beings to Hydrochlorofluorocarbons 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population . Although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known , the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl - altered liver proteins are involved . In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds , there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives ."}

Tamoxifen ( Tamoxifen ) , the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer , induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia . This work evaluates the effects of Tamoxifen on isolated human erythrocytes , attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on Tamoxifen - induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms . Tamoxifen induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration . The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples , but 12 . 5 microM Tamoxifen induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions . Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis , Tamoxifen does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes . The hemolytic effect of Tamoxifen is prevented by low concentrations of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - tocopherol ) and alpha - tocopherol acetate ( alpha - tocopherol acetate ) ( inactivated functional hydroxyl ) indicating that Tamoxifen - induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage . This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with Tamoxifen - induced hemolysis . Furthermore , it was observed that Tamoxifen inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH , thus ruling out Tamoxifen - induced cell oxidative stress . Hemolysis caused by Tamoxifen was not preceded by the leakage of K ( + ) from the cells , also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis , according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves . However , Tamoxifen induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3 . Either alpha - tocopherol or alpha - tocopherol acetate increases membrane packing and prevents Tamoxifen partition into model membranes . These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased Tamoxifen incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided . Therefore , Tamoxifen - induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane . These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by Tamoxifen , resulting in hemolytic anemia . Additionally , since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity , the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by Tamoxifen may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action ."}

In the cardiovascular system , NO is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions . Inhibition of NO synthesis induces sustained hypertension . In several models of hypertension , elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue . To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na + , we studied the response of cardiac ( Na , K ) - ATPase to NO - deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO - synthase inhibition with 40 mg / kg / day N ( G ) - nitro - L - arginine methyl ester ( L - NAME ) for 4 four weeks . After 4 - week administration of L - NAME , the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) increased by 36 % . Two weeks after terminating the treatment , the SBP recovered to control value . When activating the ( Na , K ) - ATPase with its substrate ATP , no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in NO - deficient rats . During activation with Na + , the Vmax remained unchanged , however the K ( Na ) increased by 50 % , indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the Na + - binding site in NO - deficient rats . After recovery from hypertension , the activity of ( Na , K ) - ATPase increased , due to higher affinity of the ATP - binding site , as revealed from the lowered Km value for ATP . The K ( Na ) value for Na + returned to control value . Inhibition of NO - synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed Na + - extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated Na + - binding properties of the ( Na , K ) - ATPase . After recovery of blood pressure to control values , the extrusion of Na + from cardiac cells was normalized , as revealed by restoration of the ( Na , K ) - ATPase activity ."}

Under controlled conditions , infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha ( 2 ) adrenoceptor agonist , clonidine . Previous investigations have determined that , in response to clonidine , ultrasound production increases through the 2nd - week postpartum and decreases thereafter . Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern , and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia , we hypothesized that clonidine ' s developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other . Therefore , in the present experiment , the effects of clonidine administration ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2 - , 8 - , 15 - , and 20 - day - old rats . Age - related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables , including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine - induced bradycardia . This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by - product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine ' s detrimental effects on cardiovascular function ."}

The development of thrombotic microangiopathy ( thrombotic microangiopathy ) associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented . Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange , plasma infusion , anticoagulation , and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion . However , for recipients of organ transplantation , removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss . The last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine . As a result , switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine - induced thrombotic microangiopathy . With the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation , tacrolimus - associated thrombotic microangiopathy has also been recognized . However , literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of thrombotic microangiopathy in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited . We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine - induced thrombotic microangiopathy that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy . Introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of thrombotic microangiopathy and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft .

This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract ( grape seed proanthocyanidin extract ) to prevent acetaminophen ( acetaminophen ) - induced nephrotoxicity , amiodarone ( amiodarone ) - induced lung toxicity , and doxorubicin ( doxorubicin ) - induced cardiotoxicity in mice . Experimental design consisted of four groups : control ( vehicle alone ) , grape seed proanthocyanidin extract alone , drug alone and grape seed proanthocyanidin extract + drug . For the cytoprotection study , animals were orally gavaged 100 mg / Kg grape seed proanthocyanidin extract for 7 - 10 days followed by i . p . injections of organ specific three drugs ( acetaminophen : 500 mg / Kg for 24 h ; amiodarone : 50 mg / Kg / day for four days ; doxorubicin : 20 mg / Kg for 48 h ) . Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA ( both endonuclease - dependent and independent ) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and / or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues . Results indicate that grape seed proanthocyanidin extract preexposure prior to acetaminophen , amiodarone and doxorubicin , provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation . Histopathological examination of kidney , heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract preexposure than in its presence . grape seed proanthocyanidin extract + drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery . Additionally , histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation . Interestingly , all the drugs , such as , acetaminophen , amiodarone and doxorubicin induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by grape seed proanthocyanidin extract . Since acetaminophen , amiodarone and doxorubicin undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo , the protection by grape seed proanthocyanidin extract may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and / or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals . In addition , its ' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute , which played a role in the chemoprevention process .

An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa . Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry .

HBV lamivudine - resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono - infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 HBsAg - negative - human immunodeficiency virus co - infected patients . To the best of our knowledge , this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine - resistant strains in therapy - na ve HBsAg - negative - human immunodeficiency virus co - infected patients . The HBV viral loads for mono - infected and co - infected patients ranged from 3 . 32 x 10 ( 2 ) to 3 . 82 x 10 ( 7 ) and < 200 to 4 . 40 x 10 ( 3 ) copies / ml , respectively . It remains to be seen whether such pre - existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine - containing highly active antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment ( HAART ) regimens become widely applied in South Africa , as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBsAg - negative - human immunodeficiency virus co - infected patients ."}

In acute pain models , N - methyl - D - aspartate ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) antagonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of morphine to a greater extent in males than females . The purpose of this investigation was to extend these findings to a persistent pain model which could be distinguished from acute pain models on the basis of the nociceptive fibers activated , neurochemical substrates , and duration of the nociceptive stimulus . To this end , persistent hyperalgesia was induced by administration of capsaicin in the tail of gonadally intact F344 rats , following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus , and tail - withdrawal latencies measured . For comparison , tests were conducted in two acute pain models , the hotplate and warm water tail - withdrawal procedures . In males , the non - competitive N - methyl - D - aspartate antagonist dextromethorphan enhanced the antihyperalgesic effect of low to moderate doses of morphine in a dose - and time - dependent manner . Across the doses and pretreatment times examined , enhancement was not observed in females . Enhancement of morphine antinociception by dextromethorphan was seen in both males and females in the acute pain models , with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males . These findings demonstrate a sexually - dimorphic interaction between N - methyl - D - aspartate antagonists and morphine in a persistent pain model that can be distinguished from those observed in acute pain models ."}

Methamphetamine ( Methamphetamine ) damages dopamine ( dopamine ) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated . Cardona et al . [ Nat . Neurosci . 9 ( 2006 ) , 917 ] recently identified the microglial - specific fractalkine receptor ( CX3CR1 ) as an important mediator of MPTP - induced neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons . Because the CNS damage caused by Methamphetamine and MPTP is highly selective for the dopamine neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity , we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in Methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation . Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) were treated with Methamphetamine and examined for striatal neurotoxicity . Methamphetamine depleted dopamine , caused microglial activation , and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild - type controls . The effects of Methamphetamine in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender - dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum . Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after Methamphetamine that are characteristic of activation . This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP - microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by Methamphetamine . We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate Methamphetamine neurotoxicity or microglial activation . Furthermore , it appears that striatal - resident microglia respond to Methamphetamine with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration ."}

Valvular heart abnormalities have been reported in patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( Parkinson ' s disease ) treated with pergolide . However , the incidence and severity of these abnormalities vary from study to study and their course after drug withdrawal has not been systematically assessed . OBJECTIVES : To estimate the frequency and severity of valvular heart abnormality and its possible reversibility after drug withdrawal in a case - control study . METHODS : All Parkinson ' s disease patients in the Amiens area treated with pergolide were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography . Thirty Parkinson ' s disease patients participated in the study . A second echocardiography was performed ( median interval : 13 months ) after pergolide withdrawal ( n = 10 patients ) .

BACKGROUND : Papaverine hydrochloride is a direct - acting vasodilator used to manage vasospasm during various neurosurgical operations . Transient cranial nerve dysfunction has been described in a few cases with topical papaverine . This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve . METHODS : We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical papaverine for vasospasm . Topical papaverine was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage vasospasm in a total of 11 patients . The timing of papaverine application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings . Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEPs ) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations . FINDINGS : A temporal relationship was found between topical papaverine and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss . The average temporal delay between papaverine and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min . In 10 of 11 patients , BAEP waves II / III - V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after papaverine . Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min . One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound sensorineural hearing loss . The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre - papaverine baseline values was 39 min . CONCLUSIONS : Topical papaverine for the treatment of vasospasm was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway . The complete disappearance of BAEP waveforms with a consistent temporal delay suggests a possible adverse effect on the proximal eighth nerve . Recommendations to avoid potential cranial nerve deficits from papaverine are provided ."}

The aldosterone - sensitive serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and salt excess . The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome . To this end , doxorubicin ( 15 mug / g body wt ) was injected intravenously into gene - targeted mice lacking SGK1 ( sgk1 ( - / - ) ) and their wild - type littermates ( sgk1 ( + / + ) ) . Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria ( > 100 mg protein / mg crea ) in 15 / 44 of sgk1 ( + / + ) and 15 / 44 of sgk1 ( - / - ) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites , lipidemia , and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes . Plasma aldosterone levels increased in nephrotic mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice . Urinary sodium excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice ( 15 + / - 5 mumol / mg crea ) than in sgk1 ( - / - ) mice ( 35 + / - 5 mumol / mg crea ) and was associated with a significantly higher body weight gain in sgk1 ( + / + ) compared with sgk1 ( - / - ) mice ( + 6 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 vs . + 4 . 1 + / - 0 . 8 g ) .

BACKGROUND : Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection , and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) - based regimens . To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus . We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use . In each patient , the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria . METHODS : We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999 - 2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen . In these patients , the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein : creatinine ratios , an estimate of grams of proteinuria / day . Laboratory results were compared between prior , during and following sirolimus use . RESULTS : Twenty - eight patients ( 24 % ) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post - transplantation course . In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive . In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic - range proteinuria . Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables . In most patients , discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease , but not resolution , of proteinuria .

Seventy - one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition ( placebo , 10 - mg oxycodone ) . Plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose ( P < . 01 ) and pupil size , an indication of physiological effects of the medication , peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose ( P < . 01 ) .

For comparison of sleep architecture variables , 12 healthy comparison participants underwent a single night of experimental polysomnography that followed 1 night of accommodation polysomnography . RESULTS : Progressive abstinence from cocaine was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes . Compared with placebo , modafinil decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow - wave sleep time in cocaine - dependent participants . The effect of modafinil interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence . Comparison of slow - wave sleep time , total sleep time , and sleep latency in cocaine - dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of modafinil in cocaine - dependent participants .

Abstract Serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) therapy . However , hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin - ezetimibe . We describe a 70 - year - old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg / day to simvastatin 10 mg - ezetimibe 40 mg / day . The patient ' s lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity . A routine laboratory work - up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels . Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram ( which she was taking for depression ) were discontinued , and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded . A repeat work - up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels , and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate - to - severe drug toxicity . She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course . Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23 , and her 2 - year follow - up showed no adverse events . Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases ( UGT ) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid , resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity . To our knowledge , this is the first case report of simvastatin - ezetimibe - induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation . We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe - induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes .

AIM : The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of \" meth mouth \" and the medical risks associated with this serious condition . BACKGROUND : Methamphetamine is a very addictive , powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dysrhythmias , hypertension , hallucinations , and violent behavior . Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene , xerostomia , rampant caries ( \" meth mouth \" ) , and excessive tooth wear . Oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challenging . CASE DESCRIPTION : A 30 - year - old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain , bad breath , and self - reported poor esthetics . A comprehensive examination including her medical history , panoramic radiograph , and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions , which is not very common for a healthy adult . She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug . SUMMARY : The patient ' s medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of \" meth mouth . \" Although three different dental treatment modalities ( either conventional or implant - supported ) have been offered to the patient since August 2007 , the patient has yet to initiate any treatment . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE : This clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing methamphetamines . Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients , as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification ."}

Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine - induced dopaminergic terminal damage . In this study , we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide , a pro - inflammatory and inflammatory factor , treatment in modulating the methamphetamine - induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity . Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine - elicited hyperthermia three days later . Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine - induced striatal dopamine and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose - dependent manner . As the most potent dose ( 1 mg / kg ) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks , one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen , methamphetamine - induced striatal dopamine and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered . Moreover , systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment ( 1 mg / kg ) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion - produced dopamine and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum , indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine . We concluded a critical time window for systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment in exerting effective protection against methamphetamine - induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity ."}

BACKGROUND : There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of ketamine , a unique anesthetic , for emergency - department procedures requiring sedation . The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children ' s fractures in the emergency department . METHODS : One hundred and fourteen children ( average age , 5 . 3 years ; range , twelve months to ten years and ten months ) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level - I trauma center were prospectively evaluated . Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously ( at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight ) in ninety - nine of the patients and intramuscularly ( at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight ) in the other fifteen . A board - certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic , and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse . Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children ' s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS ) . RESULTS : The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty - six seconds ( range , twenty seconds to five minutes ) , and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty - two seconds ( range , sixty seconds to fifteen minutes ) . The average score according to the Children ' s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6 . 4 points ( range , 5 to 10 points ) , reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction . Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children . Ninety - nine percent ( sixty - eight ) of the sixty - nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation . Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients . Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable . Minor side effects included nausea ( thirteen patients ) , emesis ( eight of the thirteen patients with nausea ) , clumsiness ( evident as ataxic movements in ten patients ) , and dysphoric reaction ( one patient ) . No long - term sequelae were noted , and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares . CONCLUSIONS : Ketamine reliably , safely , and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children ' s fractures in the emergency department at our institution . Ketamine should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department , where proper one - on - one monitoring is used and board - certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient ."}

OBJECTIVE : to analyze aspects of TEE safety associated to the use of Midazolan ( Midazolan ) and Flumazenil ( Flumazenil ) and the influence of the clinical variables on the event rate . METHOD : prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with Midazolan associated to moderate sedation . We analyzed the following events : complications related with the topical anesthesia , with Midazolan use and with the procedure . Uni - and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables : age , sex , stroke , myocardiopathy ( myocardiopathy ) , duration of the test , mitral regurgitation ( mitral regurgitation ) and the Midazolan dose . RESULTS : All patients ( 65 + / - 16 yrs ; 58 % males ) finished the examination . The mean doses of Midazolan and Flumazenil were 4 . 3 + / - 1 . 9 mg and 0 . 28 + / - 0 . 2 mg , respectively . The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction ( EF ) were 16 . 4 + / - 6 . 1 minutes and 60 + / - 9 % , respectively . Mild hypoxia ( SO2 < 90 % ) was the most common event ( 11 patients ) ; 3 patients ( 2 % ) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 ( 5 . 8 % ) due to hypoxia caused by Midazolan use . Transient hypotension ( SAP < 90mmHg ) occurred in 1 patient ( 0 . 7 % ) . The multivariate analysis showed that severe mitral regurgitation , myocardiopathy ( EF < 45 % ) and high doses of Midazolan ( > 5mg ) were associated with events ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The EF was 40 % , in the group with myocardiopathy and 44 % in the group with severe mitral regurgitation and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group .

OBJECTIVES : The United Kingdom Parkinson ' s Disease Research Group ( UKPDRG ) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( Parkinson ' s disease ) randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L - dopa compared with those taking L - dopa alone . Recently , we found that therapy with selegiline and L - dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline . This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure . The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension . METHODS : The cardiovascular responses to standing and head - up tilt were studied repeatedly in Parkinson ' s disease patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn . RESULTS : Head - up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 Parkinson ' s disease patients on selegiline , one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures . A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing . Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug . Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action . CONCLUSION : This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L - dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension . The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non - selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed ."}

Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale ( 0 - 100 ) digitized at 1 / s , either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection . Subjects also recalled their pains one week later . Capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose - dependent flare ( p < 0 . 001 ) without any difference within or across sessions . The strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes . Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses ( both p < 0 . 001 ) , regardless of whether first - time ratings were requested immediately , after one hour or after one day . Pain recall after one week was similarly precise ( magnitude : p < 0 . 01 , duration : p < 0 . 05 ) . Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first - time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection ( R ( 2 ) = 0 . 79 ) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces . These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced pain . The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage , and may take up to one day ."}

This study tested the hypothesis that activation of nociceptive muscle afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex and whether this process would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stretch . Capsaicin ( 10 micro g ) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce pain in 11 healthy volunteers . Short - latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before , during , and after the pain . The normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement , but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity . The normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during pain , but only at faster stretches in the painful muscle . Increased sensitivity of the fusimotor system during acute muscle pain could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings ."}

INTRODUCTION : Many substances that form methemoglobin ( MHb ) effectively counter cyanide ( CN ) toxicity . Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning , it has been proposed that a stable , long - acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment . Using this rationale , the 8 - aminoquinoline WR242511 , a potent long - lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs , was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment . METHODS : In this study , WR242511 was administered intravenously ( IV ) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3 . 5 and / or 7 . 0 mg / kg ; a single male also received WR242511 orally ( PO ) at 7 . 0 mg / kg . Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure . RESULTS : The selected doses of WR242511 , which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere , produced very little MHb ( mean < 2 . 0 % ) in the rhesus monkey . Furthermore , transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 ( 3 . 5 or 7 . 0 mg / kg ) , and 2 lethalities occurred ( one IV and one PO ) following the 7 . 0 mg / kg dose . Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7 . 0 mg / kg dose . Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity , with greater severity in the orally - treated animal . CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate direct and / or indirect drug - induced toxicity . It is concluded that WR242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN poisoning unless the anti - CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable toxicity ."}

OBJECTIVE : The outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse is reportedly poor . However , no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome . METHODS : A review of admissions during a 6 - year period revealed 14 patients with cocaine - related aneurysms . This group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with ruptured aneurysms and no history of cocaine abuse . Age at presentation , time of ictus after intoxication , Hunt and Hess grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage , size of the aneurysm , location of the aneurysm , and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared . RESULTS : The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group ( P < 0 . 002 ) . In patients in the study group , all aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation . The majority of these aneurysms were smaller than those of the control group ( 8 + / - 6 . 08 mm versus 11 + / - 5 . 4 mm ; P = 0 . 05 ) . The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant . Hunt and Hess grade ( P < 0 . 005 ) and age ( P < 0 . 007 ) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with cocaine - related aneurysms .

The authors present three patients with de novo absence epilepsy after administration of carbamazepine and vigabatrin . Despite the underlying diseases , the prognosis for drug - induced de novo absence seizure is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs . The gamma - aminobutyric acid - transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the absence epilepsy . Because drug - induced de novo absence seizure is rare , pro - absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor . The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo absence seizure . The possibility of drug - induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in seizure frequency and / or new seizure types appear following a change in drug treatment . By understanding the underlying mechanism of absence epilepsy , we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with epilepsy and prevent drug - induced absence seizures ."}

METHODS : The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi - SPECT / dobutamine stress test . Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP / dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level . In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT . The increase in dP / dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non - ischemic group . dP / dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results , giving an ECG - enhanced value , and compared to ECG alone .

Immune escape variants of the hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) represent an emerging clinical challenge , because they can be associated with vaccine escape , HBV reactivation , and failure of diagnostic tests . Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals . We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants , the sG145R and sP120T mutants , on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment - associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine ( lamivudine ) and / or HBeAg negativity . Replication - competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and lamivudine resistance ( rtM204I or rtL180M / rtM204V ) were generated on an HBeAg - positive and an HBeAg - negative background with precore ( PC ) and basal core promoter ( BCP ) mutants . The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of lamivudine - resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild - type HBV , and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication . Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion , it did not enhance the replication of lamivudine - resistant clones .

OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease . METHOD : In a 6 - week random - assignment , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( phase A ) , haloperidol , 2 - 3 mg / day ( standard dose ) , and haloperidol , 0 . 50 - 0 . 75 mg / day ( low dose ) , were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer ' s disease . For the subsequent 6 - week double - blind crossover phase ( phase B ) , patients taking standard - or low - dose haloperidol were switched to placebo , and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard - or low - dose haloperidol . RESULTS : For the 60 patients who completed phase A , standard - dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low - dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation . Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose ( 55 % - 60 % ) than the low dose ( 25 % - 35 % ) and placebo ( 25 % - 30 % ) . The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B . In phase A , extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions , primarily because of a subgroup ( 20 % ) who developed moderate to severe signs . Low - dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects . CONCLUSIONS : The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2 - 3 mg / day , although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs . A starting dose of 1 mg / day with gradual , upward dose titration is recommended . The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer ' s disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors ."}

BACKGROUND : In man , differences in angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) levels , related to ACE ( I / D ) genotype , are associated with renal prognosis . This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage . Therefore , we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats . METHODS : Renal ACE activity ( Hip - His - Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates ) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats . After 1 week of recovery , proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [ 1 . 5 mg / kg intravenously ( i . v . ) n = 18 ; controls , saline i . v . n = 9 ] . Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks . After 12 weeks , rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested . RESULTS : As anticipated , adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria , renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis . Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin ( r = 0 . 62 , P < 0 . 01 ) , renal interstitial alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 49 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial macrophage influx ( r = 0 . 56 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial collagen III ( r = 0 . 53 , P < 0 . 05 ) , glomerular alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 74 , P < 0 . 01 ) and glomerular desmin ( r = 0 . 48 , P < 0 . 05 ) . Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis ( r = 0 . 22 , NS ) . In controls , no predictive values for renal parameters were observed . CONCLUSION : Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin - induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain . This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage ."}

The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ( mGluR5 ) in the toxic action of methamphetamine on dopaminergic neurones in rats . Methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) , administered five times , reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection . A selective antagonist of mGluR5 , 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine ( 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine ; 5 mg / kg ip ) , when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above - mentioned methamphetamine effects . A single 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine ( 5 mg / kg ip ) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum , as well as dopamine release stimulated either by methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine ( 100 microM ) . Moreover , it transiently diminished the methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) - induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature . 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine administered into the striatum at high concentrations ( 500 microM ) increased extracellular dopamine levels , while lower concentrations ( 50 - 100 microM ) were devoid of any effect . The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine - induced toxicity . Neuroprotection rendered by 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine may be associated with the reduction of the methamphetamine - induced dopamine efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5 , and with a decrease in hyperthermia ."}

OBJECTIVE : In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme ( CYP ) 2D6 . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity , using desipramine as a probe substrate , in healthy subjects . METHODS : Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized , open - label , crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine ( 50 mg ) on two separate occasions , once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet ( 90 mg for 7 days ) . Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose . RESULTS : Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms . Relative to desipramine alone , mean AUC and C ( max ) of desipramine increased 3 . 6 - and 1 . 8 - fold when coadministered with cinacalcet . The t ( 1 / 2 , z ) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet ( 21 . 0 versus 43 . 3 hs ) . The t ( max ) was similar between the regimens . Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet ( 33 versus 86 % ) , the most frequent of which ( nausea and headache ) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet . CONCLUSION : This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 . These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet , dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6 ."}

Hepatocyte tight junctions ( TJs ) , the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces , play a key role in bile formation . Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis , attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze - fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information . Recently , several TJ - associated proteins like ZO - 1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized . Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability . We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol ( ethinyl estradiol ) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation ( BDL ) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage . Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double - immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO - 1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope . In control rats , immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion . In contrast , 7H6 and ZO - 1 immunostaining was more discontinuous , outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL . Immunostaining for 7H6 , not ZO - 1 , decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL . After ethinyl estradiol treatment , changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO - 1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL , but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule . This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and ethinyl estradiol treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability ."}

Azidothymidine ( Azidothymidine ) - induced anemia in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF - IL - 3 ( fusion protein of insulin - like growth factor II ( IGF II ) and interleukin 3 ) . Although interleukin 3 ( IL - 3 ) and erythropoietin ( EPO ) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro , injection of IGF - IL - 3 and EPO in Azidothymidine - treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF - IL - 3 or EPO alone . We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL - 3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells . Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF - IL - 3 . There was a significant reduction of thymidine incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre - treated with IGF - IL - 3 and EPO . Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL - 3 significantly reduced thymidine incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone .

All negative chronotropic effects were BF - dependent . Dose - dependent bradycardia induced by verapamil was potentiated by LNa , LCa , and HCa . Independent but not additive effects of Na and Ca are shown by decreases in the values of [ verapamil ] o needed to reduce BF by 30 % ( IC30 ) with the following order of inhibitory potency : LNa > LCa > HCa > N , resulting LNa + HCa similar to LNa . The [ verapamil ] o that arrested atrial beating ( AC ) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa + LCa = LNa + HCa = LCa > HCa = N .

MATERIALS AND METHODS : From November 2005 to September 2007 , 8 patients ( 5 men and 3 women ) were diagnosed as having metronidazole - induced encephalopathy ( age range ; 43 - 78 years ) . They had been taking metronidazole ( total dosage , 45 - 120 g ; duration , 30 days to 2 months ) to treat the infection in various organs . Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) were obtained after the hospitalization , including DWI ( 8 / 8 ) , apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) map ( 4 / 8 ) , FLAIR ( 7 / 8 ) , and T2 - weighted image ( 8 / 8 ) . Follow - up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration . Findings of initial and follow - up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus , to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities , their locations , and signal changes on follow - up images . RESULTS : Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR ( or T2 - weighted image ) at the dentate nucleus ( 8 / 8 ) , inferior colliculus ( 6 / 8 ) , corpus callosum ( 2 / 8 ) , pons ( 2 / 8 ) , medulla ( 1 / 8 ) , and bilateral cerebral white matter ( 1 / 8 ) .

Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation . In addition , we performed a high - resolution 3D gradient echo , T1 - weighted sequences at a 1 - mm slice thickness .

BACKGROUND : Cardiac troponins I ( cTnI ) and T ( cTnT ) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial cell injury . We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin ( doxorubicin ) - induced cardiomyopathy , and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model . METHODS : Thirty - five Wistar rats were given 1 . 5 mg / kg doxorubicin , i . v . , weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg / kg BW . Ten rats received saline as a control group . cTnI was measured with Access ( R ) ( ng / ml ) and a research immunoassay ( pg / ml ) , and compared with cTnT , CK - MB mass and CK . By using transthoracic echocardiography , anterior and posterior wall thickness , LV diameters and LV fractional shortening ( FS ) were measured in all rats before doxorubicin or saline , and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats . Histology was performed in doxorubicin - rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last doxorubicin dose and in all controls . RESULTS : Eighteen of the doxorubicin rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9 - week period . End - diastolic ( ED ) and end - systolic ( ES ) LV diameters / BW significantly increased , whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the doxorubicin group ( p < 0 . 001 ) . These parameters remained unchanged in controls . Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given doxorubicin revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis . In 7 of the 18 rats , degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found . Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis . A significant rise in cTnT was found in doxorubicin rats after cumulative doses of 7 . 5 and 12 mg / kg in comparison with baseline ( p < 0 . 05 ) . cTnT found in rats after 12 mg / kg were significantly greater than that found after 7 . 5 mg / kg doxorubicin . Maximal cTnI ( pg / ml ) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in doxorubicin rats compared with controls ( p = 0 . 006 , 0 . 007 ) . cTnI ( ng / ml ) , CK - MB mass and CK remained unchanged in doxorubicin rats compared with controls . All markers remained stable in controls . Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters / BW ( r = 0 . 81 and 0 . 65 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes , and between LV diameters / BW and histological findings . CONCLUSIONS : Among markers of ischemic injury after doxorubicin in rats , cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes . Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after doxorubicin , probably due to heterogeneity in cross - reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms , it is likely that cTnT in rats after doxorubicin indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments ."}

The haemodynamic effects of adding 15 , 20 or 25 mg of ephedrine to 200 mg of propofol were compared to control in 40 ASA 3 / 4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito - urinary surgery . The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study . However , marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients , occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients . Due to the risk of this tachycardia inducing myocardial ischemia , we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the ephedrine / propofol / mixtures studied ."}

BACKGROUND : Fibrin sealants ( FS ) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery . In order to increase clot stability , FS typically contain aprotinin , a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor . Recently , synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tranexamic acid ) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin . However , tranexamic acid has been shown to cause epileptic seizures . We wanted to study whether tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS . METHOD : FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tranexamic acid ( 0 . 5 - 47 . 5 mg / ml ) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats . The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia . FINDINGS : FS containing tranexamic acid caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours . The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tranexamic acid . Thus , FS containing 47 . 5 mg / ml tranexamic acid evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n = 6 ) while the lowest concentration of tranexamic acid ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats . In contrast , FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity . INTERPRETATION : Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS . Thus , use of FS containing tranexamic acid for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient ."}

Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency . The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross - sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine . After a 30 - min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0 ) , animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12 - h deprivation followed by 12 - h access to 10 % sucrose solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period ) for 21 days . Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access . Beginning on day 22 , all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow . Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) . The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10 % sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection , cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection , ad libitum chow with amphetamine , or cyclic 10 % sucrose and chow with a saline injection ) . These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine , possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system ."}

In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall , together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells . The aorta / serum - ratio and the radioactive build - up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I - HSA was reduced in animals treated with D - penicillamine for 42 days , indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate . The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D - penicillamine , and no differences in aortic 131I - HSA radioactivity or aorta / serum - ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection , indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D - penicillamine treatment . These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of D - penicillamine may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta , possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross - linking of collagen and elastin ."}

Anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs , but they frequently cause dose - related cardiotoxicity . The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction . We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin ( daunorubicin ) - containing regimen . Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a daunorubicin - containing regimen . Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies . The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography . Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy . Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy . The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit ( 40 pg / ml ) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography . On the other hand , BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given daunorubicin , even at more than 700 mg / m ( 2 ) . The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure . These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity ."}

BACKGROUND : Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood . With current treatment regimens including combined surgery , radiation and chemotherapy , the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year . Therefore , patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen . Generally , carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin , whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known . However , we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin , which is infrequently reported . CASE : A 58 - year - old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe . He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection . Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen . RESULTS : He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection . Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle - closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished , inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks . Finally , 6 weeks later , diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost . CONCLUSION : When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin , we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity .

Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man , the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized . There is a need for a well - defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied . In four subacute toxicity studies , the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose - dependent incidence of anemia , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia after 1 - 3 months of treatment . A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50 % of dogs receiving 400 - 500 mg / kg cefonicid or 540 - 840 mg / kg cefazedone . All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment ; the time required for recovery of the erythron ( approximately 1 month ) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets ( hours to a few days ) . Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin , the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested ; cefonicid ( but not cefazedone ) - treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period ( 15 + / - 5 days ) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug ( 61 + / - 24 days ) . This observation , along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs , suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia .

The patient with nitrazepam overdose and two of those with chlormethiazole intoxication conformed to the criteria of ' alpha coma ' , showing non - reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG . The fourth patient who was unconscious after chlormethiazole administration exhibite generalized non - reactive activity in the slow beta range . All four recovered completely without neurological sequelae following the withdrawal of the offending agents . The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological depression of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed . It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo - thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha coma . It is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication , in the absence of significant hypoxaemia , a favourable outcome may be anticipated ."}

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane , postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently . Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this , although it may also improve analgesia . METHODS : This double - blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients . Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl , while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl . RESULTS : Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting , but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and / or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20 % and 17 % with fentanyl and fentanyl - dexamethasone , respectively , to 5 % ( P = 0 . 013 ) . Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24 % and 31 % to 7 % ( P = 0 . 0012 ) . Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting . Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids , reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35 % and 33 % to 22 % and 19 % ( P = 0 . 049 and P = 0 . 035 ) , respectively , while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42 % to 27 % ( P = 0 . 034 ) . Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl . Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane - sparing effect and increased respiratory depression , hypotension and bradycardia . CONCLUSION : As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects , it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery ."}

BACKGROUND : Cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second - or third - line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma . Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8 % when 60 - 120 mg / m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3 - 4 weeks . Although a dose - response effect has been observed with cisplatin , the dose - limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin ( e . g . , nephrotoxicity , ototoxicity , and neurotoxicity ) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma . WR - 2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war . Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy . Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity , ototoxicity , and neuropathy were reduced . METHODS : A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one , but not more than one , chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease . Patients received amifostine , 910 mg / m2 intravenously over 15 minutes . After completion of the amifostine infusion , cisplatin 120 mg / m2 was administered over 30 minutes . Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin . Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression . RESULTS : Forty - four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 ( 16 % ) were ineligible . A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients . Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16 % . Most patients ( 57 % ) stopped treatment because of disease progression . Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52 % of patients . Seven different life - threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment . CONCLUSIONS : The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16 % . Neither a tumor - protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this trial ."}

The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non - selective ( piroxicam ) and selective ( DFU ; 5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5H ) - furanon ) COX - 2 inhibitors . METHODS : Drugs were separately , orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 ( GD1 = plug day ) . Doses were set at 0 . 3 , 3 . 0 and 30 . 0mg / kg for piroxicam and 0 . 2 , 2 . 0 and 20 . 0mg / kg for DFU . Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined . Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done . The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal ( VSD ) and midline defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam , selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitor based on present and historic data . RESULTS : Maternal toxicity , intrauterine growth retardation , and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam . Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose . Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU - exposed groups . Prenatal exposure to non - selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX - 2 inhibitors . CONCLUSION : Both selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose . Unlike DFU , piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams . Prenatal exposure to selective COX - 2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non - selective drugs and historic control ."}

Allopregnanolone ( 3alpha - hydroxy - 5alpha - pregnan - 20 - one ) , pregnanolone ( 3alpha - hydroxy - 5beta - pregnan - 20 - one ) and ganaxolone ( a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha - hydroxy - 3beta - methyl - 5alpha - pregnan - 20 - one ) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression ( anticonvulsant effect ) and development ( antiepileptogenic effect ) of cocaine - kindled seizures in male , Swiss - Webster mice . Kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg / kg cocaine for 5 days . All of these positive GABA ( A ) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures , whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling . Allopregnanolone and pregnanolone , but not ganaxolone , also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling .

BACKGROUND : A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia ( 2 % ) and renal insufficiency ( 0 % ) . Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported , the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice . We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone . METHODS : We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice . Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia ( K ( + ) > 5 . 0 mEq / L ) or renal insufficiency ( Cr > or = 2 . 5 mg / dL ) , and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case . Clinical characteristics , medications , and serum chemistries at baseline and follow - up time periods were compared . RESULTS : Sixty - seven of 926 patients ( 7 . 2 % ) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia ( n = 33 ) or renal failure ( n = 34 ) . Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes , had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses , and were more likely to be treated with beta - blockers than controls ( n = 134 ) . Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine , required higher doses of loop diuretics , and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls . CONCLUSIONS : Spironolactone - induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously . This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta - blockers ."}

BACKGROUND : The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic . Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLTX ) has dramatically improved success rates . Recently , however , we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end - stage renal disease ( End - stage renal disease ) . This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of End - stage renal disease and chronic renal failure ( chronic renal failure ) in OLTX patients . METHODS : Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied ( n = 834 ) . Our prospectively collected database was the source of information . Patients were divided into three groups : Controls , no chronic renal failure or End - stage renal disease , n = 748 ; chronic renal failure , sustained serum creatinine > 2 . 5 mg / dl , n = 41 ; and End - stage renal disease , n = 45 . Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables , diagnosis , postoperative variables , survival , type of End - stage renal disease therapy , and survival from onset of End - stage renal disease . RESULTS : At 13 years after OLTX , the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18 . 1 % ( chronic renal failure 8 . 6 % and End - stage renal disease 9 . 5 % ) . Compared with control patients , chronic renal failure and End - stage renal disease patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels , a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome , higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively , and a higher 1 - year serum creatinine . Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year , 3 months , and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of chronic renal failure or End - stage renal disease with odds ratios of 2 . 6 , 2 . 2 , and 1 . 6 , respectively . Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups , but by year 13 , the survival of the patients who had End - stage renal disease was only 28 . 2 % compared with 54 . 6 % in the control group . Patients developing End - stage renal disease had a 6 - year survival after onset of End - stage renal disease of 27 % for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71 . 4 % for the patients developing End - stage renal disease who subsequently received kidney transplants . CONCLUSIONS : Patients who are more than 10 years post - OLTX have chronic renal failure and End - stage renal disease at a high rate . The development of End - stage renal disease decreases survival , particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only . Patients who develop End - stage renal disease have a higher preoperative and 1 - year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome .

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : The Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial ( INWEST ) found a correlation between nimodipine - induced reduction in blood pressure ( BP ) and an unfavorable outcome in acute stroke . We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of blood pressure reduction . METHODS : Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke ( within 24 hours ) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo ( n = 100 ) , 1 mg / h ( low - dose ) nimodipine ( n = 101 ) , or 2 mg / h ( high - dose ) nimodipine ( n = 94 ) . The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed . RESULTS : Two hundred sixty - five patients were included in this analysis ( n = 92 , 93 , and 80 for placebo , low dose , and high dose , respectively ) . Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) and diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days . In multivariate analysis , a significant correlation between diastolic blood pressure reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high - dose group ( beta = 0 . 49 , P = 0 . 048 ) . Patients with a diastolic blood pressure reduction of > or = 20 % in the high - dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or dependency ( Barthel Index < 60 ) ( n / N = 25 / 26 , OR 10 . 16 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 to 101 . 74 ) and death alone ( n / N = 9 / 26 , OR 4 . 336 , 95 % CI 1 . 131 16 . 619 ) compared with all placebo patients ( n / N = 62 / 92 and 14 / 92 , respectively ) . There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome . CONCLUSIONS : DBP , but not SBP , reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high - dose nimodipine after acute stroke . For low - dose nimodipine , the results were not conclusive . These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine ."}

BACKGROUND : Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms ( transient neurologic symptoms ) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine . However , identification of a short - acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal . Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine . Accordingly , the present , prospective double - blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of transient neurologic symptoms . METHODS : Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2 . 5 ml 2 % lidocaine in 7 . 5 % glucose , 2 % prilocaine in 7 . 5 % glucose , or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine in 7 . 5 % glucose . All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy . Details of spinal puncture , extension and regression of spinal block , and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted . In the evening of postoperative day 1 , patients were evaluated for transient neurologic symptoms by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure . RESULTS : Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced transient neurologic symptoms , 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine ( P = 0 . 03 ) had them , and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had transient neurologic symptoms . Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine ( 150 vs . 165 min and 238 vs . 253 min , respectively ) but prolonged after bupivacaine ( 200 and 299 min , respectively ; P < 0 . 05 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of transient neurologic symptoms ."}

Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease . Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis , but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect . Almost certainly , nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events , although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide . Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans . Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events . Finally , the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat , suggesting that if nicotine is involved , adverse effects might be seen with relatively low - level cigarette exposures ."}

Octreotide , an effective treatment for acromegaly , induces gall bladder stones in 13 - 60 % of patients . Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis , treatment , and prevention , this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegalic patients with gall stones . Chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients , showed that they contained 71 % and 87 % cholesterol by weight . In the remaining 12 patients , localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units ( values of < 100 HU predict cholesterol rich , dissolvable stones ) . Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided , fine needle puncture from six patients . All six patients had supersaturated bile ( mean ( SEM ) cholesterol saturation index of 1 . 19 ( 0 . 08 ) ( range 1 . 01 - 1 . 53 ) ) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol microcrystal nucleation times ( < 4 days ( range 1 - 4 ) ) , whilst in four , the bile contained cholesterol microcrystals immediately after sampling . Of the 12 patients considered for oral ursodeoxycholic acid ( ursodeoxycholic acid ) treatment , two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on ursodeoxycholic acid while one was lost to follow up . After one year of treatment , five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial ( n = 3 ) or complete ( n = 2 ) gall stone dissolution , suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich . This corresponds , by actuarial ( life table ) analysis , to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58 . 3 ( 15 . 9 % ) . In conclusion , octreotide induced gall stones are generally small , multiple , and cholesterol rich although , in common with spontaneous gall stone disease , at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some gall stones containing calcium ."}

The half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of cocaine is relatively short , but some of the consequences of its use , such as seizures and strokes , can occur hours after exposure . This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae . We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine , benzoylecgonine ( benzoylecgonine ) , to cause seizures . Two separate equimolar doses ( 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mumol ) of either cocaine or benzoylecgonine were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats . Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence , latency , and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seizures . benzoylecgonine - Induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of cocaine . Whereas cocaine - induced seizures were best characterized as brief , generalized , and tonic and resulted in death , those induced by benzoylecgonine were prolonged , often multiple and mixed in type , and rarely resulted in death . Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expression . benzoylecgonine - Injected rats that did not have seizures had significantly more locomotor activity than cocaine - injected animals without seizures . The finding that cocaine - and benzoylecgonine - induced seizures differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for cocaine - induced seizures and emphasizes the importance of a cocaine metabolite , benzoylecgonine ."}

Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole - treated rats is reported . A single 18 . 4 mg / kg ( i . p . ) dose of ( + / - ) - amphetamine hemisulfate , given to rats pretreated with iprindole , resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later . This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine ( MK - 801 , a non - competitive antagonist of N - methyl - D - aspartate receptors ) or by LY274614 ( a competitive antagonist of N - methyl - D - aspartate receptors ) . The protective effect of LY274614 was dose - dependent , being maximum at 10 - 40 mgkg ( i . p . ) . A 10 mg / kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum , when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine . Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine ; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine .

Hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido . Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this , the mechanisms are poorly understood . We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility : pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen - induced LH surge . Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40 % reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats , but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol . Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid - induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge . Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( PRL - R ) and components of prolactin ' s signaling pathway . To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL - R expression and sensitivity to prolactin , we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin - induced STAT5 activation . Lastly , we measured PRL - R and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS - 1 and - 3 and CIS , which reflect the level of prolactin signaling ) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol . Sulpiride induced only SOCS - 1 in the medial preoptic area , where GnRH neurons are regulated , but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus , PRL - R , SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels were also induced . Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS - 3 and CIS . Interestingly , estradiol also induced PRL - R , SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels independently . These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid - dependent manner . They also provide evidence for estradiol - dependent and brain region - specific regulation of PRL - R expression and signaling responses by prolactin ."}

Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir . Many patients , however , develop negative long - term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis . We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice . Furthermore , peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir - treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation . In the present study , we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir . We have utilized the human monocyte cell line , THP - 1 as a model to address this question . Briefly , cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage - like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta - estradiol ( E2 ) , 100 nM progesterone or vehicle ( 0 . 01 % ethanol ) . Cells were then treated with 30 ng / ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h . Cell extracts were harvested , and lipid or total RNA was isolated . E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment . Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor , CD36 mRNA , responsible for the uptake of LDL . Additionally , ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA , a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression . Treatment with E2 , however , failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level . E2 did , however , significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry . This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte - derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment ."}

PURPOSE : The multidrug resistance protein 2 ( MRP2 ) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) . MRP2 is absent in the transport - deficient ( TR ( - ) ) Wistar rat mutant , so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2 - deficient rats with those in transport - competent Wistar rats . By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB . However , one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur . This prompted us to study the brain expression of P - glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues , including the BBB , in TR ( - ) rats compared with nonmutant ( wild - type ) Wistar rats . METHODS : The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR ( - ) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry , by using a novel , highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219 , respectively . RESULTS : Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats , whereas such labeling was absent in TR ( - ) rats . TR ( - ) rats exhibited a significant up - regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild - type controls . No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections . A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine - induced seizures in wild - type Wistar rats . Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR ( - ) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB . CONCLUSIONS : The data on TR ( - ) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB . Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds , the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB . Furthermore , our data suggest that TR ( - ) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain , without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp - enhancing events for this purpose ."}

Mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis , such as energy generation , control of cell death , neurotransmitter synthesis , and free radical ( FR ) production . Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA - encoded subunits . In this study , we investigated whether increased generation of FR during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase ( CCO ) , complex IV of the respiratory chain , in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy . DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4 . 8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups . We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA - encoded subunit of CCO ( CCO - I ) or a relative decrease in CCO - I when compared with nuclear - encoded subunits ( CCO - IV and SDH - fp ) . No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry . Although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies , our results do not suggest that the FRs , generated during the acute phase , determined important abnormalities in mtDNA , in expression of CCO - I , and in CCO activity ."}

In postrenal transplantation , thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome . We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1 - year period , from June 2003 to June 2004 , at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies ( n = 25 ) performed during this interval . Pre - and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible . RESULTS : Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found . Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital , while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow - up . Three cases were related to cyclosporine , and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus . The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus . CONCLUSIONS : In the literature , the most - frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome . Other causes include drug - related ( cyclosporine , tacrolimus ) toxicity , procoagulant status , and antibody - mediated rejection . We found that the most - frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related , secondary mainly to cyclosporine .

OBJECTIVE : To assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer , and its relation to cyclophosphamide , in patients with Wegener ' s granulomatosis . METHODS : In the population based , nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener ' s granulomatosis , 1969 - 95 , was identified . Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register , all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified . Nested within the cohort , a matched case - control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios ( ORs ) as relative risk . In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener ' s granulomatosis , and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis , were also estimated . RESULTS : The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases ( n = 11 ) and controls ( n = 25 ) were 113 g and 25 g , respectively . The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide ( OR = 2 . 0 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0 . 8 to 4 . 9 ) . Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk ( OR = 7 . 7 , 95 % CI 0 . 9 to 69 ) . The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10 % 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis , and a history of bladder cancer was ( non - significantly ) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener ' s granulomatosis . CONCLUSION : The results indicate a dose - response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer , high cumulative risks in the entire cohort , and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before Wegener ' s granulomatosis ."}

Anencephaly has been suggested to develop from exencephaly ; however , there is little direct experimental evidence to support this , and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear . We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid - to late - gestation mouse embryos . We observed the exencephaly induced by 5 - azacytidine at embryonic day 13 . 5 ( E13 . 5 ) , let the embryos develop exo utero until E18 . 5 , and re - observed the same embryos at E18 . 5 . We confirmed several cases of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly . However , in many cases , the exencephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period . To analyze the transformation patterns , we classified the exencephaly by size and shape of the exencephalic tissue into several types at E13 . 5 and E18 . 5 . It was found that the transformation of exencephalic tissue was not simply size - dependent , and all cases of anencephaly at E18 . 5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of exencephalic tissue at E13 . 5 . Microscopic observation showed the configuration of exencephaly at E13 . 5 , frequent hemorrhaging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the exencephalic head at E15 . 5 , and multiple modes of reduction in the exencephalic tissue at E18 . 5 .

The effect of amantadine hydrochloride , injected i . p . in 6 increments of 100 mg / kg each over 30 hr , on mouse motility and whole brain content of selected biogenic amines and major metabolites was studied in 4 strains of mice . These were the albino Sprague - Dawley ICR and BALB / C , the black C57BL / 6 and the brown CDF - I mouse strains . Amantadine treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse motility . The initial dose of amantadine depressed locomotor activity in all mouse strains studied with the BALB / C mice being the most sensitive . Subsequent amantadine treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the BALB / C mice being the least sensitive . The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied , except for the ICR mice , during an overnight drug - free period following the fourth amantadine treatment . Readministration of amantadine , after a drug - free overnight period , increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB / C mice where suppression of motility occurred . Treatment with amantadine did not alter whole brain dopamine levels but decreased the amounts of 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the BALB / C mice compared to saline control . Conversely , brain normetanephrine concentration was increased from saline control by amantadine in the BALB / C mice . The results suggest a strain - dependent effect of amantadine on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used . The BALB / C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of amantadine . The biochemical results of brain biogenic amines of BALB / C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of catecholamine turnover rate and / or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in O - methylation of norepinephrine which may account for a behavioral depression caused by amantadine in the BALB / C mice ."}

Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure . The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized . The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid - base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs . The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle . During the infusion of aminophylline , the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen ( PO2 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) were kept within normal limits . When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation ( pH 7 . 05 to 7 . 25 ; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg : P02 20 to 40 mm Hg ) , infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level .

INTRODUCTION : Intoxications with carbachol , a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare . We report an interesting case investigating a ( near ) fatal poisoning . METHODS : The son of an 84 - year - old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer ' s disease . The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound ' carbamylcholin ' ; that is , carbachol . He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy , and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg . Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC - mass spectrometry . RESULTS : Minutes after oral administration , the patient developed nausea , sweating and hypotension , and finally collapsed . Bradycardia , cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred . Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline ( epinephrine ) , atropine and furosemide was successful . On hospital admission , blood pressure of the intubated , bradyarrhythmic patient was 100 / 65 mmHg . Further signs were hyperhidrosis , hypersalivation , bronchorrhoea , and severe miosis ; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio - ventricular dissociation . High doses of atropine ( up to 50 mg per 24 hours ) , adrenaline and dopamine were necessary . The patient was extubated 1 week later . However , increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation . Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction . One week later , the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward . On the next day he died , probably as a result of heart failure . Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3 . 6 and 1 . 9 mg / l carbachol , respectively . The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg / l .

PURPOSE : We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography . METHODS : We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan , which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company , which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera . RESULTS : Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded , reporting a total of 3 , 774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2 , 820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992 . Before angiography , intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing , or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions . For three patients , the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing . The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg , depending upon the institution . There were 13 cases of adverse reactions ( 0 . 34 % ) , ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea , exanthema , urtication , itchiness , and urgency to defecate , and did not require treatment . Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein , which required treatment , and two cases of hypotension . The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock .

PURPOSE : The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive NO synthase ( L - NOArg ; 1 . 0 mg / kg ip ) , a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase ( L - NIL ; 1 . 0 mg / kg ip ) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase ( 7 - NI ; 0 . 1 mg / kg ip ) , on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B2 and B1 receptors : D - Arg - [ Hyp3 , Thi5 , D - Tic7 , Oic8 ] bradykinin ( HOE 140 ; 70 nmol / kg ip ) or des Arg10 HOE 140 ( 70 nmol / kg ip ) respectively , in model of diabetic ( streptozotocin - induced ) and toxic ( vincristine - induced ) neuropathy was investigated . METHODS : The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli - - the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall - Selitto . RESULTS : The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia . Pretreatment with L - NOArg and L - NIL but not 7 - NI , significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140 . It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine . Moreover , L - NOArg and 7 - NI but not L - NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des - Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy . CONCLUSIONS : Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy . In streptozotocin - induced hyperalgesia , inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin , whereas in vincristine - induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway . Therefore , concomitant administration of small doses of bradykinin receptor antagonists and NO synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of neuropathic pain , even in hospital care ."}

INTRODUCTION : Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens . In high doses , its nonhematological dose - limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy . STUDY DESIGN : We combined paclitaxel , melphalan and high - dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin in a triple sequential high - dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer . Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy - responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96 - h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high - dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure ( congestive heart failure ) and the following pretreatment characteristics : presence of electrocardiogram ( EKG ) abnormalities , age , hypertension , prior cardiac history , smoking , diabetes mellitus , prior use of anthracyclines , and left - sided chest irradiation . RESULTS : Six of 61 women ( 10 % ) developed clinically reversible grade 3 congestive heart failure following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31 % . Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide - related cardiac toxicity ( 10 % ) is comparable to previous recorded literature . Older age was significantly correlated with the congestive heart failure development ; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing congestive heart failure of 45 and 59 , respectively . No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics . CONCLUSIONS : As a result of these findings , oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients .

METHODS : Fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin . Serum hemoglobin , haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin - 2 were investigated before and after therapy . RESULTS : We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period . Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment . In contrast with the literature , serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy . We found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin . CONCLUSION : This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis C and we could not find any relation .

Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced - behaviour is poorly understood . Nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms . Therefore NFkappaB activity , oxidative stress , neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS ) activity , spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate , a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction , were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats . NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats , as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus , whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased . Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex . In contrast , learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase . These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine . Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed , showing novel neuroprotective properties ."}

Curcumin has shown antioxidant , anti - inflammatory and neuro - protective properties . Therefore , the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone - and carbamazepine - induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats . Pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were also studied . Vehicle / drugs were administered daily for 21days to male Wistar rats . Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function . At the end of study period , serum phenobarbitone and carbamazepine , whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated . The administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress . Concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs . Curcumin co - administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phenobarbitone as well as carbamazepine . These results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentrations .

BACKGROUND : Nicotine polacrilex lozenges deliver 25 % to 27 % more nicotine compared with equivalent doses of nicotine polacrilex gum . The increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum . OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge and 4 - mg nicotine gum in smokers with selected label - restricted diseases . METHODS : This was a multicenter , randomized , open - label study in adult smokers with heart disease , hypertension not controlled by medication , and / or diabetes mellitus . Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge or 4 - mg nicotine gum . Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 12 weeks after the start of product use . RESULTS : Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment , 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum ( safety population ) . The majority were women ( 52 . 7 % ) . Patients ' mean age was 53 . 9 years , their mean weight was 193 . 9 pounds , and they smoked a mean of 25 . 2 cigarettes per day at baseline . Five hundred fifty - three patients , 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum , used the study product for > or = 4 days per week during the first 2 weeks ( evaluable population ) .

Monkeys with acute ( short - term ) MPTP exposure , rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy developed dyskinesia between 11 and 24 days of daily levodopa administration .

Pain not responsive to morphine is often problematic . Animal and clinical studies have suggested that N - methyl - D - aspartate ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) antagonists , such as ketamine , may be effective in improving opioid analgesia in difficult pain syndromes , such as neuropathic pain . A slow bolus of subhypnotic doses of ketamine ( 0 . 25 mg / kg or 0 . 50 mg / kg ) was given to 10 cancer patients whose pain was unrelieved by morphine in a randomized , double - blind , crossover , double - dose study . Pain intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical scale ; nausea and vomiting , drowsiness , confusion , and dry mouth , using a scale from 0 to 3 ( not at all , slight , a lot , awful ) ; Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) ( 0 - 30 ) ; and arterial pressure were recorded before administration of drugs ( T0 ) and after 30 minutes ( T30 ) , 60 minutes ( T60 ) , 120 minutes ( T120 ) , and 180 minutes ( T180 ) . Ketamine , but not saline solution , significantly reduced the pain intensity in almost all the patients at both doses . This effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses . Hallucinations occurred in 4 patients , and an unpleasant sensation ( \" empty head \" ) was also reported by 2 patients . These episodes reversed after the administration of diazepam 1 mg intravenously . Significant increases in drowsiness were reported in patients treated with ketamine in both groups and were more marked with ketamine 0 . 50 mg / kg . A significant difference in MMSE was observed at T30 in patients who received 0 . 50 mg / kg of ketamine . Ketamine can improve morphine analgesia in difficult pain syndromes , such as neuropathic pain . However , the occurrence of central adverse effects should be taken into account , especially when using higher doses . This observation should be tested in studies of prolonged ketamine administration ."}

PURPOSE : We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1 , 022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history , results of physical examination , other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost - effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay . Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire , gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng . / ml . Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results . Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1 , 340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination . Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire , small testes and gynecomastia . Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia . RESULTS : Testosterone was less than 3 ng . / ml . in 107 patients but normal in 40 % at repeat determination . The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age ( 4 % before age 50 years and 9 % 50 years or older ) . Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination . Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction ( definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [ 36 % ] after androgen therapy , normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30 % and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42 % ) . Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40 % of the cases with low testosterone , including 37 % of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy . Prolactin exceeded 20 ng . / ml . in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination . Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered . These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades ( overall prolactin greater than 20 ng . / ml . in 1 . 86 % of 1 , 821 patients , prolactinomas in 7 , 0 . 38 % ) . Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml . ( 8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng . / ml . ) . Testosterone was low in less than 50 % of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml . CONCLUSIONS : Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination . However , cost - effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50 % of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors . We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years . Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire , gynecomastia and / or testosterone less than 4 ng . / ml ."}

This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms / kg / min . In long - term infusion studies , flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta - blocking dose ( 5 micrograms / kg / min ) for up to seven days . Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta - adrenergic blockade . Flestolol produced a dose - dependent attenuation of isoproterenol - induced tachycardia . Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers . In contrast with other beta blockers , flestolol - induced effects reverse rapidly ( within 30 minutes ) following discontinuation because of its short half - life . Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia . In patients with unstable angina , flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain .

Fifty - two patients suffering from intractable tinnitus entered this therapeutic trial , but only nine finished all five courses . In one patient , the tinnitus was almost completely abolished , but in all the nine patients the decompensated tinnitus changed to a compensated one . We suggest this mode of treatment for patients that were previously treated by drugs , acupuncture and biofeedback , with disappointing results . Patients should be warned about the side effects of vertigo and vomiting , which subsides gradually with every new instillation , and that the tinnitus may not disappear but will be alleviated , enabling them to cope more easily with the disease and lead a more normal life ."}

The effect of humoral modulators on the morphine - induced increase in locomotor activity of mice was studied . The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg / kg of morphine - HC1 produced a marked increase in locomotor activity in mice . The morphine - induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine . In contrast , both methscopolamine and neostigmine , which do not penetrate the blood - brain barrier , had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine . Pretreatment of mice with alpha - methyltyrosine ( 20 mg / kg i . p . , one hour ) , an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase , significantly decreased the activity - increasing effects of morphine . On the other hand , pretreatment with p - chlorophenylalamine ( 3 X 320 mg / kg i . p . , 24 hr ) , a serotonin depletor , caused no significant change in the hyperactivity . The study suggests that the activity - increasing effects of morphine are mediated by the release of catecholamines from adrenergic neurons in the brain . And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine acts by retarding the release of acetylcholine at some central cholinergic synapses . It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity - increasing effects of morphine in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity - increasing effects of morphine in rats ."}

PATIENTS AND METHODS : The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . The men were randomly assigned to bupropion SR ( 150 mg twice daily , 117 ) or placebo ( twice daily , 117 ) for 12 weeks . Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression - Sexual Function ( CGI - SF ; the primary outcome measure ) , the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF ) , Arizona Sexual Experience Scale ( ASEX ) , and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction ( EDITS ) ( secondary outcome measures ) . Participants were followed biweekly during study period .

Previous studies have demonstrated that Rg1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morphine . The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect . Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine ( 10 mg / kg ) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days , and Rg1 ( 30 mg / kg ) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days . Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze . The results showed that rats treated with Morphine / Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency . By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo , the results showed that Rg1 restored the long - term potentiation ( LTP ) impaired by morphine in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats . The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine , but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline - or morphine / Rg1 - treated rats ; this restoration could be inhibited by N - methyl - D - aspartate ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) receptor antagonist MK801 . We conclude that Rg1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic morphine administration and restore the morphine - inhibited LTP .

AIM : This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin . BACKGROUND : Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described , the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented . DESIGN : This study was designed as within - subject , quasi - experimental research . METHOD : The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered . Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site . Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection . Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper . The visual analog scale ( VAS ) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop - watch was used to time the pain period . Data were analysed using chi - square test , Mann - Whitney U , Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation . RESULTS : The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64 % with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42 % in the 30 - second injection . It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30 - second injection . Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30 - second injection than for the 10 - second injection .

After the treatments and behavioral observation , glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed . A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol , compared to the control . Importantly , a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia .

All three had been diagnosed earlier with epilepsy , and their electroencephalogram ( EEG ) findings were abnormal . During monitoring , visual hallucinations did not correlate with EEG readings , nor did video recording capture any of the described events . None of the patients had experienced visual hallucinations before this event . The only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of zonisamide . With either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur . Further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effect . Until then , clinicians need to be aware of this possible complication associated with zonisamide ."}

Glomerular epithelial protein 1 ( GLEPP1 ) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes . This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process . To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of glomerular injury , the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry , Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat . Puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside ( puromycin aminonucleoside , 20 mg / 100g BW ) . Tissues were analyzed at 0 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 21 , 45 , 80 and 126 days after puromycin aminonucleoside injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement ( days 5 - 11 ) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis ( days 45 - 126 ) . At day 5 , GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range ( 265 . 2 + / - 79 . 6 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerulus and 100 % ) to 15 % of normal ( 41 . 8 + / - 4 . 8 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerulus , p < 0 . 005 ) . This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1 . 8 + / - 1 to 99 . 0 + / - 61 mg / day ( p < 0 . 001 ) . In contrast , podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time . By day 11 , GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline . By day 45 - 126 , at a time when glomerular scarring was present , GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal . We conclude that GLEPP1 expression , unlike podocalyxin , reflects podocyte injury induced by puromycin aminonucleoside . GLEPP1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury ."}

These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug - induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents . Apomorphine , a nonselective dopamine agonist , was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects , its ability to induce hypothermia , and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain . From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine - induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed . In rats , detection of apomorphine - induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions . Moreover , test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug - induced hypothermia . In mice , apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage . Drug - induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only , while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both . By contrast , apomorphine - induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box . Dopamine turnover ratios ( DOPAC : DA and HVA : DA ) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts . However , apomorphine - induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments . The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents ."}

BACKGROUND : Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia . The serotonin 6 ( 5 - HT6 ) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics , such as clozapine and olanzapine , and d - amphetamine - induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist . In addition , the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d - amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5 - HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats . These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia , and the above evidence suggests that altered 5 - HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders . The symptoms of methamphetamine ( methamphetamine ) - induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia . Therefore , we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5 - HT6 gene ( HTR6 ) with methamphetamine - induced psychosis . METHOD : Using five tagging SNPs ( rs6693503 , rs1805054 , rs4912138 , rs3790757 and rs9659997 ) , we conducted a genetic association analysis of case - control samples ( 197 methamphetamine - induced psychosis patients and 337 controls ) in the Japanese population .

METHODS : We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg , a known convulsive dose 50 ( CD50 ) , on the incidence and severity of bupropion - induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice . A total of 69 mice , approximately 7 weeks of age , and weighing 21 . 0 to 29 . 1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion HCl 120 mg / kg treatment by intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration in 7 groups ( 9 to 10 animals per group ) .

AIM : To determine the hemodynamic responses , efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) studies . BACKGROUND : Dexmedetomidine has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies . Over time , an effective protocol utilizing high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative agent has evolved . METHODS / MATERIALS : As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process , data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed . Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received dexmedetomidine for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007 . RESULTS : Since 2005 , the 10 - min loading dose of our dexmedetomidine protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg . kg ( - 1 ) , and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1 . 5 to 2 microg . kg ( - 1 ) . h ( - 1 ) . The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation ( able to complete the imaging study ) when using dexmedetomidine alone from 91 . 8 % to 97 . 6 % ( P = 0 . 009 ) , reducing the requirement for adjuvant pentobarbital in the event of sedation failure with dexmedetomidine alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min ( P < 0 . 001 ) .

OBJECTIVES : To assess patients ' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with propofol , and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index ( BIS ) monitoring . METHODS : This was a prospective , single - intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28 , 2002 , and October 31 , 2003 . BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status . At 1 - minute intervals during the procedural sedation , until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure , a word from a standardized list was read aloud , and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator . The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient ' s ability to repeat the word were recorded . After the procedure , the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall , and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed . RESULTS : Seventy - five consenting patients were enrolled ; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation . No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations . The mean ( + / - standard deviation ) time of data collection was 16 . 4 minutes ( + / - 7 . 1 ; range 5 to 34 minutes ) . The mean initial ( preprocedure ) BIS score was 97 . 1 ( + / - 2 . 3 ; range 92 to 99 ) . The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66 . 9 ( + / - 14 . 4 ; range 33 to 91 ) . The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77 . 1 ( 95 % CI = 74 . 3 to 80 . 0 ) . The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81 . 5 ( 95 % CI = 78 . 1 to 84 . 8 ) . The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96 . 7 ( + / - 2 . 4 ; range 84 to 98 ) . The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 88 . 1 to 94 . 3 ) . All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol . The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91 . 5 ( + / - 11 . 1 ; range 79 to 98 ) , and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90 . CONCLUSIONS : There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words . Furthermore , patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation , suggestive of retrograde amnesia ."}

Doxorubicin is an anti - tumor agent that represses cardiac - specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis . Doxorubicin depletes cardiac p300 , a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes . However , the role of p300 in protection against doxorubicin - induced apoptosis is unknown . Transgenic mice overexpressing p300 in the heart and wild - type mice were subjected to doxorubicin treatment . Compared with wild - type mice , transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha - sarcomeric actin .

BACKGROUND : Doxorubicin induces a self - perpetuating nephropathy characterized by early glomerular and late - onset tubular lesions in rats . We investigated the potential role of mitochondrial injury in the onset of these lesions . METHODS : Rats were treated with intravenous doxorubicin ( 1 mg kg ( - 1 ) week ( - 1 ) ) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ( ' short - term ' ) or 30 weeks ( ' long - term ' ) following the last dose . Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia . All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age . Glomerular and tubular injury was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components . Finally , we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) as well as superoxide production and the 4834 base pair ' common ' mtDNA deletion . RESULTS : The ' long - term ' group had significant glomerular and tubular lesions , depressed activities of mtDNA - encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome - c oxidase ( COX ) and increased citrate synthase activity . In addition , expression of the mtDNA - encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased . In ' short - term ' rats , there were fewer tubular lesions , but similar numbers of glomerular lesions activity . Among all animals , glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels , mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain subunit COX - I . Injury was positively correlated with superoxide production and the activities of nucleus - encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes . Kidneys from the ' long - term ' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in ' short - term ' animals and these were not observed in the other groups . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain function and induction of superoxide in doxorubicin - induced renal lesions ."}

OBJECTIVE : To report a case of multiple episodes of seizure activity in an AIDS patent following amphotericin B infusion . CASE SUMMARY : A 46 - year - old African - American man experienced recurrent grand mal seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B , then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time . The patients concurrent medications included didanosine , hydroxyzine , promethazine , hydrocortisone , and prochlorperazine . Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam , the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration . DISCUSSION : AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis , both of which the patient had , can potentially cause seizures . The patient had a history of alcohol abuse ; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures . Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures . However , these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out . The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient .

OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen ( once - daily vs . twice - daily ) of tobramicyn on steady - state serum concentrations and toxicity . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Patients undergoing treatment with i . v . tobramycin ( 4 mg / kg / day ) were randomised to two groups . Group OD ( n = 22 ) received a once - daily dose of tobramycin and group TD ( n = 21 ) received the same dose divided into two doses daily . Tobramycin serum concentrations ( peak and trough ) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay . The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before , during and immediately after treatment . RESULTS : The two groups were comparable with respect to sex , age , body weight and renal function . No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose , duration of treatment , or cumulative dose . Trough concentrations were < 2 g / ml in the two groups ( 100 % ) . Peak concentrations were > 6 microg / ml in 100 % of the OD group and in 67 % of the TD group ( P < 0 . 01 ) . Mean peak concentrations were markedly different : 11 . 00 + / - 2 . 89 microg / ml in OD vs . 6 . 53 + / - 1 . 45 microg / ml in TD ( P < 0 . 01 ) .

In TD group , three patients developed decreased auditory function , of which one presented with an auditory loss of - 30 dB , whereas in the OD group only one patient presented decreased auditory function . CONCLUSION : This small study suggests that a once - daily dosing regimen of tobramycin is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice - daily regimen .

BACKGROUND : Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson ' s disease , but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short - term follow - up . METHODS : Forty patients with Parkinson ' s disease underwent serial , detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ( \" off \" period ) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ( \" on \" period ) . All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months ; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year , and 11 at two years . RESULTS : The percent improvements at six months were as follows : off - period score for overall motor function , 28 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 19 to 38 percent ) , with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs ; off - period score for activities of daily living , 29 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 19 to 39 percent ) ; on - period score for contralateral dyskinesias , 82 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 72 to 91 percent ) ; and on - period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias , 44 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 29 to 59 percent ) . The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off - period parkinsonism , contralateral bradykinesia , and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years . The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year , and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months . Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery . The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated , and there were no significant changes in the use of medication . CONCLUSIONS : In late - stage Parkinson ' s disease , pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa - induced dyskinesias and off - period disability . Much of the benefit is sustained at two years , although some improvements , such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms , wane within the first year .

This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block seizure - like events following high - frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices . The pilocarpine ( pilocarpine ) model of epilepsy is characterized by an acute period of status epilepticus followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures and related brain damage .

It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation . The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis . The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual - perfusion technique and with thallium - 201 single - photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) . During a transient ( 20 - s ) coronary occlusion , a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced . The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 74 ; p less than 0 . 002 ) . During dipyridamole - induced hyperemia , 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography . The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild ( 0 % to 50 % ) reduction in dipyridamole - induced hyperemia . The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 61 ; p = 0 . 02 ) . Thallium - 201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole - induced hyperemia ; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 58 ; p less than 0 . 03 ) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography ( r = 0 . 58 ; p less than 0 . 03 ) . Thus , myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis . The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium - 201 SPECT ."}

Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific drug - induced acute liver injury . His condition was further complicated by sepsis and coagulopathy . Death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms . The likelihood that bupropion induced hepatotoxicity in our patient was possible , based on the Naranjo probability scale . DISCUSSION : Although there is increasing evidence of hepatotoxicity induced by bupropion , this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute liver failure in a patient receiving bupropion while on concomitant treatment with carbimazole . CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute liver insult induced by bupropion given concurrently with other hepatotoxic drugs ."}

BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women . This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005 . OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , cardiovascular outcomes , cancer , gallbladder disease , cognition , fractures and quality of life . SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases to November 2007 : Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts . Also relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts . SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women . HT included oestrogens , with or without progestogens , via oral , transdermal , subcutaneous or transnasal routes . DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data . MAIN RESULTS : Nineteen trials involving 41 , 904 women were included . In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism or coronary event ( after one year ' s use ) , stroke ( after three years ) , breast cancer and gallbladder disease . Long - term oestrogen - only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism , stroke and gallbladder disease ( after one to two years , three years and seven years ' use respectively ) , but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer . The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and ( for combined HT ) colon cancer , with long - term use . Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy ( i . e . generally fit , without overt disease ) and taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia . Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo - embolism . One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups . The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo - embolism in women taking combined continuous HT : their absolute risk remained low , at less than 1 / 500 . However , this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women . AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease . We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women ."}

AIM : Widespread use of mannitol to reduce brain edema and lower elevated ICP in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so - called rebound phenomenon . Leakage of mannitol into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound . This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals . As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of mannitol into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients . METHODS : Mannitol ( 18 % solution ; 1 g / kg ) was administered as a bolus to patients ( ten had malignant glioma , seven brain metastases and four meningioma ) about 30 minutes before craniotomy . During resection , a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample . Mannitol concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al . RESULTS : In most glioma patients , mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma ( mean 3 . 5 times ) . In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of mannitol were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells . CONCLUSIONS : The results of our study show that even after a single bolus , mannitol may leak through the altered BBB near gliomas , reversing the initial plasma - to - blood osmotic gradient , aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of ICP ."}

Following administration of these agents , the presence , and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered . The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions . Twenty - four hours later , any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management . The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS ( p < 0 . 001 ) . At 24 h , the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR ( p < 0 . 05 ) . A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation . The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups . In conclusion , where succinylcholine is used , lidocaine is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of postoperative myalgia ."}

PURPOSE : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin ( 500 mg orally once daily for 10 to 14 days ) in treating adult outpatients with acute bacterial sinusitis . PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers . All patients had a pre - therapy Gram ' s stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy . Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results . Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre - therapy pathogen ( s ) . RESULTS : The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Moraxella catarrhalis . Of 300 clinically evaluable patients , 175 ( 58 % ) were cured and 90 ( 30 % ) were improved at the post - therapy evaluation , resulting in a clinical success rate of 88 % . Thirty - five patients ( 12 % ) clinically failed treatment . The microbiologic eradication rate ( presumed plus documented ) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92 % . Microbiologic eradication rates ( presumed plus documented ) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93 % ( M . catarrhalis ) to 100 % ( S . pneumoniae ) at the post - therapy visit .

Among various oral antiplatelets , a combination of a novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost ( beraprost ) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol ( cilostazol ) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate ( cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate ) . Thereby , a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted . Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take beraprost / cilostazol in the following schedule ; beraprost : 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t . i . d . from day 7 to 14 , cilostazol : 200 mg t . i . d . from day 3 to 14 . At various time intervals , physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate were performed . Throughout the observation period , no significant alteration in vital signs was observed . Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one , especially after ingestion of cilostazol . All of these symptoms , probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents , were of mild degree and no special treatment was required . Intraplatelet cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate content was gradually but significantly increased to 9 . 84 + / - 4 . 59 pmol per 10 ( 9 ) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value ( 6 . 87 + / - 2 . 25 pmol ) . The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted . In conclusion , the combined administration of beraprost / cilostazol is safe at doses used in the study , though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated ."}

OBJECTIVE : A randomised , double - blind study to compare the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerability , safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( rheumatoid arthritis ) . PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 4086 patients ( mean age 60 . 8 years ) diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily ( n = 2032 ) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily ( n = 2054 ) . Use of gastroprotective agents and low - dose aspirin was allowed . The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences ( AEs ) . General safety was also assessed , including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data . Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status ( PGADS ; 0 - 4 point scale ) . RESULTS : Mean ( SD ; maximum ) duration of treatment was 19 . 3 ( 10 . 3 ; 32 . 9 ) and 19 . 1 ( 10 . 4 ; 33 . 1 ) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups , respectively . The cumulative discontinuation rate due to gastrointestinal adverse experiences was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac ( 5 . 2 vs 8 . 5 events per 100 patient - years , respectively ; hazard ratio 0 . 62 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 47 , 0 . 81 ; p < or = 0 . 001 ) ) . The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension - related and oedema - related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib ( 2 . 5 % and 1 . 1 % respectively ) compared with diclofenac ( 1 . 5 % and 0 . 4 % respectively ; p < 0 . 001 for hypertension and p < 0 . 01 for oedema ) .

METHODS : Data were analyzed from four similarly designed , randomized , double - blind , 3 - to 12 - week studies . Two studies evaluated quetiapine monotherapy ( up to 800 mg / day ) ( n = 209 ) versus placebo ( n = 198 ) , with lithium or haloperidol monotherapy as respective active controls . Two studies evaluated quetiapine ( up to 800 mg / day ) in combination with a mood stabilizer ( lithium or divalproex , QTP + Li / DVP ) ( n = 196 ) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer ( PBO + Li / DVP ) ( n = 203 ) . Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated using the Simpson - Angus Scale ( SAS ) , the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) , adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage . RESULTS : The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms - related adverse events , including akathisia , was no different with quetiapine monotherapy ( 12 . 9 % ) than with placebo ( 13 . 1 % ) . Similarly , extrapyramidal symptoms - related adverse events with QTP + Li / DVP ( 21 . 4 % ) were no different than with PBO + Li / DVP ( 19 . 2 % ) . Adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms occurred in 59 . 6 % of patients treated with haloperidol ( n = 99 ) monotherapy , whereas 26 . 5 % of patients treated with lithium ( n = 98 ) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms . The incidence of akathisia was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy ( 3 . 3 % ) and placebo ( 6 . 1 % ) , and with QTP + Li / DVP ( 3 . 6 % ) and PBO + Li / DVP ( 4 . 9 % ) . Lithium was associated with a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 05 ) of tremor ( 18 . 4 % ) than quetiapine ( 5 . 6 % ) ; cerebellar tremor , which is a known adverse effect of lithium , may have contributed to the elevated rate of tremor in patients receiving lithium therapy .

A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus . Male Sprague - Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day ( P ) 20 , or a convulsant dose of pilocarpine on P20 or P45 .

Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction , stroke , hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors . Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly , but not exclusively , in patients with concomitant risk factors . Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal , vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention . The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time . A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance - specific differences , which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin - independent effects .

Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication . OBJECTIVE : To quantify specific clinical predictors of reduction in renal function in patients with congestive heart failure who are prescribed angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy . METHOD : We analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction ( SOLVD ) , a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of congestive heart failure . There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow - up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow - up of 967 days . Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine > / = 0 . 5 mg / dL ( 44 micromol / L ) from baseline . We used time - to - event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age , baseline ejection fraction , baseline creatinine , low systolic blood pressure ( < 100 mm Hg ) , history of hypertension , diabetes , and use of antiplatelet , diuretic , and beta - blocker therapy . RESULTS : Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33 % greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls ( P = . 003 ) . By multivariate analysis , in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age , diuretic therapy , and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function , whereas beta - blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective . Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups , but significantly more so in the enalapril group ( enalapril : risk ratio [ RR ] 1 . 42 per 10 years , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 32 - 1 . 52 with enalapril ; placebo : RR 1 . 18 , 95 % CI 1 . 12 - 1 . 25 ) . Diuretic therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of decreased renal function in the enalapril group ( RR 1 . 89 , 95 % CI 1 . 70 - 2 . 08 ) than in the placebo group ( RR 1 . 35 , 95 % CI 1 . 09 - 1 . 66 ) . Conversely , enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect ( RR 1 . 33 , 95 % CI 1 . 13 - 1 . 53 ) compared with placebo ( RR 1 . 96 , 95 % CI 1 . 57 - 2 . 44 ) in patients with diabetes .

Pretreatment with ammonium acetate ( NH4Ac ) ( 6 mmol / kg s . c . ) approximately doubled the time morphine - treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular incoordination by diazepam , but NH4Ac treatment alone had no effect . Thus , hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease . Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine - induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50 % by 0 . 3 mM NH4Ac and KCl - induced contractions of guinea - pig ileum were inhibited 20 % by 5 mM NH4Ac . Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues , but calcium - independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac . These results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels . Parallels in the actions of NH4Ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept . Both verapamil ( 10 mg / kg i . p . ) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia - and diazepam - induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine - induced motor activity , and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol . The data suggest that hyperammonemia exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics ."}

Despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast media - induced nephropathy ( contrast media - induced nephropathy ) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures , the studies in pediatrics are limited , with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography . This prospective study determined the incidence of contrast media - induced nephropathy for two nonionic contrast media ( contrast media ) , iopromide and iohexol , among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of contrast media and the presence of cyanosis . The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide ( group A , n = 40 ) or iohexol ( group B , n = 40 ) . Serum sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , and creatinine ( creatinine ) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values , then measured again at 12 - , 24 - , and 48 - h intervals after contrast media use . Urine samples for Na and creatinine also were checked at the same intervals . Risk of renal failure , Injury to the kidney , Failure of kidney function , Loss of kidney function , and End - stage renal damage ( RIFLE criteria ) were used to define contrast media - induced nephropathy and its incidence in the study population . Accordingly , among the 15 contrast media - induced nephropathy patients ( 18 . 75 % ) , 7 . 5 % of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3 . 75 % had renal injury , whereas 5 % of group B had increased risk and 2 . 5 % had renal injury . Whereas 33 . 3 % of the patients with contrast media - induced nephropathy were among those who received the proper dosage of contrast media , the percentage increased to 66 . 6 % among those who received larger doses , with a significant difference in the incidence of contrast media - induced nephropathy related to the different dosages of contrast media ( p = 0 . 014 ) . Among the 15 patients with contrast media - induced nephropathy , 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases , but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients ( p = 0 . 243 ) . Although clinically silent , contrast media - induced nephropathy is not rare in pediatrics . The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic contrast media , nor on the presence of cyanosis , and although contrast media - induced nephropathy usually is reversible , more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children ."}

PURPOSE : To map and identify the pattern , in vivo , of axonal degeneration in ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . Ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis . A serious complication of ethambutol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , and color vision . However , early on , when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible , the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss . METHODS : Three subjects with a history of ethambutol ( ethambutol ) - induced optic neuropathy of short - , intermediate - , and long - term visual deficits were administered a full neuro - ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity , color vision , contrast sensitivity , and fundus examination . In addition , OCT ( OCT 3000 , Humphrey - Zeiss , Dublin , CA ) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) analysis protocol . OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL . RESULTS : The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT , n = 661 . In all subjects with history of ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy , there was a mean loss of 72 % nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant ( patient A , with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields , 58 % loss ; patient B , with intermediate visual deficits , 68 % loss ; patient C , with chronic visual deficits , 90 % loss ) , with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26 + / - 16 microm . There was a combined mean loss of 46 % of fibers from the superior , inferior , and nasal quadrants in the ( six ) eyes of all three subjects ( mean average thickness of 55 + / - 29 microm ) . In both sets ( four ) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits ( patients B and C ) , there was an average loss of 79 % of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant . CONCLUSIONS : The OCT results in these patients with ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers . This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo - cellular axons ( or small - caliber axons ) within the papillo - macular bundle in toxic or hereditary optic neuropathies . OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuropathies . Additionally , in terms of management of ethambutol - induced optic neuropathy , it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached ."}

We evaluated cardiovascular event data for valdecoxib , a new COX - 2 - specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials . The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events ( cardiac , cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular , or arterial thrombotic ) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib ( 10 - 80 mg daily ) , nonselective NSAID ( diclofenac 75 mg bid , ibuprofen 800 mg tid , or naproxen 500 mg bid ) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6 - 52 weeks in duration .

The inferior colliculus ( IC ) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information , but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system . Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing , escape - like behavior , and immobility . However , the nature of this immobility is still unclear . The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid - mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically ( 1 or 0 . 5 mg / kg ) in rats . Haloperidol - induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate N - methyl - d - aspartate receptor antagonists , MK - 801 ( 15 or 30 mmol / 0 . 5 microl ) and AP7 ( 10 or 20 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) , or of the N - methyl - d - aspartate receptor agonist N - methyl - d - aspartate ( N - methyl - d - aspartate , 20 or 30 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) . The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK - 801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy , as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar . Accordingly , intracollicular microinjection of N - methyl - d - aspartate increased the latency to step down the bar . These findings suggest that glutamate - mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol - induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity ."}

Metabotropic glutamate ( mGlu ) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson ' s disease ( Parkinson ' s disease ) .

The effects of N , N ' - dibenzhydrylethane - 1 , 2 - diamine dihydrochloride ( AMN082 ) , the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors , were thus tested in different rodent models of Parkinson ' s disease . Here , we show that oral ( 5 mg / kg ) or intrastriatal administration ( 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 nmol ) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol - induced catalepsy in rats . AMN082 ( 2 . 5 and 5 mg / kg ) reduces apomorphine - induced rotations in unilateral 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) - lesioned rats . In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of Parkinson ' s disease patients , 5 mg / kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6 - OHDA - lesioned rats .

BACKGROUND : Hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction . We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine ( nimodipine ) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin ( nitroglycerin ) - induced hypotension would preserve long - term associative memory . METHODS : The passive avoidance ( PA ) paradigm was used to assess memory retention . For PA training , latencies ( seconds ) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered . Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial . Ninety - six Swiss - Webster mice ( 30 - 35 g , 6 - 8 wk ) , were randomized into 6 groups 1 ) saline ( control ) , 2 ) nitroglycerin immediately after learning , 3 ) nitroglycerin 3 h after learning , 4 ) nitroglycerin and nimodipine , 5 ) vehicle , and 6 ) nimodipine alone . The extent of hypotension and changes in brain tissue oxygenation ( PbtO ( 2 ) ) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals . RESULTS : All groups exhibited similar training latencies ( 17 . 0 + / - 4 . 6 s ) . Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time ( 178 + / - 156 s ) compared with those injected with saline , nitroglycerin + nimodipine , or delayed nitroglycerin ( 580 + / - 81 s , 557 + / - 67 s , and 493 + / - 146 s , respectively ) . A Kruskal - Wallis 1 - way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups ( H = 15 . 34 ; P < 0 . 001 ) . In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies , the same dose of nitroglycerin ( n = 3 ) and nitroglycerin + nimodipine ( n = 3 ) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85 . 9 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg sem to 31 . 6 + / - 0 . 8 mm Hg sem and from 86 . 2 + / - 3 . 7 mm Hg sem to 32 . 6 + / - 0 . 2 mm Hg sem , respectively . Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with nimodipine alone decreased from 88 . 1 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg to 80 . 0 + / - 2 . 9 mm Hg . The intergroup difference was statistically significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) . PbtO ( 2 ) decreased from 51 . 7 + / - 4 . 5 mm Hg sem to 33 . 8 + / - 5 . 2 mm Hg sem in the nitroglycerin group and from 38 . 6 + / - 6 . 1 mm Hg sem to 25 . 4 + / - 2 . 0 mm Hg sem in the nitroglycerin + nimodipine groups , respectively . There were no significant differences among groups . CONCLUSION : In a PA retention paradigm , the injection of nitroglycerin immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long - term associative memory in mice , whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect . nimodipine attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long - term memory caused by nitroglycerin but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension . The observed effect of nimodipine may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension , because there were no differences in the PbtO ( 2 ) indices among groups ."}

The mechanism of isoproterenol - induced myocardial damage is unknown , but a mismatch of oxygen supply vs . demand following coronary hypotension and myocardial hyperactivity is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed . Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by isoproterenol . Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin - glycoprotein complex ( DGC ) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins , this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins . We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to isoproterenol subcutaneous administration . Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix . The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin . Subsequently , after lysis of myofilaments , gamma - sarcoglycan , beta - dystroglycan , beta1 - integrin , and laminin alpha - 2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown , as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process . In conclusion , administration of isoproterenol to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin , the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte . These changes , related to ischaemic injury , explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by isoproterenol ."}

This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty - acid oxidation , ATP synthesis , and upregulated JAK / STAT3 pathway . In the current study , we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40 % high fat diet ( HFD ) , which induces obesity in male Sprague - Dawley rats ( 250 - 275 g ) , sensitizes to doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity .

Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol ( toxic metabolite ) in the normal diet - fed ( ND ) and obese hearts . Mechanistic studies revealed that obese rats are sensitized due to : ( 1 ) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 , ( 2 ) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor - alpha , ( 3 ) decreased plasma adiponectin levels , ( 4 ) decreased cardiac fatty - acid oxidation ( 666 . 9 + / - 14 . 0 nmol / min / g heart in ND versus 400 . 2 + / - 11 . 8 nmol / min / g heart in obese ) , ( 5 ) decreased mitochondrial AMP - alpha2 protein kinase , and ( 6 ) 86 % drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP / ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration . Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK / STAT3 pathway .

PATIENTS : Sixty patients were pretreated in a randomized double - blinded fashion with remifentanil 1 microg / kg or placebo . Two minutes after remifentanil or placebo injection , etomidate 0 . 3 mg / kg was given . MEASUREMENTS : Myoclonus was recorded with a scale of 0 to 3 . The grade of sedation ( none , mild , moderate , severe ) , nausea , pruritus , and apnea were recorded after injection of both drugs . MAIN RESULTS : The incidence of myoclonus was significantly lower in the remifentanil group ( 6 . 7 % ) than in the placebo group ( 70 % ) ( P < 0 . 001 ) . None of the patients experienced sedation , apnea , nausea , or pruritus after injection of both drugs . In the placebo group , male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of myoclonus after etomidate administration . CONCLUSION : Pretreatment with remifentanil 1 microg / kg reduced myoclonus after etomidate induction without side effects such as sedation , apnea , nausea , or pruritus . Men experience increased incidence of myoclonus than women after etomidate administration ."}

The choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) activator , which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine ( acetylcholine ) , is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer ' s disease ( Alzheimer ' s disease ) . Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect ( 46 % ) on ChAT in vitro . Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana , the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein ( 4 ' , 7 - dihydroxy - isoflavone ) . In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine - induced impairments of learning and memory , we conducted a series of in vivo tests . Administration of daidzein ( 4 . 5 mg / kg body weight ) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine - induced amnesia , according to the results of a Y - maze test . Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y - maze tests ( a 37 % decreases in alternation behavior ) . By way of contrast , mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment ( an approximately 12 % - 21 % decrease in alternation behavior ) . These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator , and that it also ameliorates scopolamine - induced amnesia ."}

CASE SUMMARY : A 76 - year - old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of pharyngitis . Hiccups were persistent and exhausting . Discontinuation of azithromycin and therapy with baclofen finally resolved hiccups . No organic cause of hiccups was identified despite extensive investigation . DISCUSSION : Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with hiccups . Corticosteroids ( dexamethasone and methylprednisolone ) , benzodiazepines ( midazolam ) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of hiccups . Few cases of drug - induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials . Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible ( score 5 points ) , mostly because of the close temporal sequence , previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups . Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient . CONCLUSIONS : Diagnosis of drug - induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination . However , macrolide antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side - effect ."}

Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase , thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception . In recent years , increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide ( nitric oxide ) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura . In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura , in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate ( glyceryl trinitrate ) ( 0 . 5 microg / kg / min for 20 min ) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura . The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and / or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced . Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls . Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject . Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after glyceryl trinitrate infusion ( p = 0 . 037 ) as well as during the following 11 h ( p = 0 . 008 ) . In the controls , the glyceryl trinitrate - induced headache gradually disappeared , whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post - infusion . At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society . The results therefore suggest that nitric oxide is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura . Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate nitric oxide in animals , this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura ."}

Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study . BACKGROUND : Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer , although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer . Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive . METHODS : In October , 1992 , we started a double - blind placebo - controlled , randomised trial of tamoxifen in women ( mainly in Italy ) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy . Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo , both orally for 5 years . The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years ' follow - up . In June , 1997 , the trialists and the data - monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study . Recruitment ended on July 11 , 1997 , and the study will continue as planned . The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer . This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention - to - treat . FINDINGS : 5408 women were randomised ; participating women have a median follow - up of 46 months for major endpoints . 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far ; there have been no deaths from breast cancer . There is no difference in breast - cancer frequency between the placebo ( 22 cases ) and tamoxifen ( 19 ) arms . There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone - replacement therapy during the trial : among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo , we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen . Compared with the placebo group , there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen . INTERPRETATION : Although this preliminary analysis has low power , in this cohort of women at low - to - normal risk of breast cancer , the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent . Women using hormone - replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen . There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study . It is essential to continue follow - up to quantify the long - term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy ."}

The H2 - histamine receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short - and long - term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states . Nineteen patients had Zollinger - Ellison syndrome , one patient had systemic mastocytosis , and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion . The rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same . The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents , and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion . However , ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed ( 1 . 2 g per day for ranitidine and 3 . 6 g per day for cimetidine ) . Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine . Treatment with high doses of cimetidine ( one to 60 months ; median , 11 months ) or ranitidine ( two to 31 months ; median , 14 months ) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations , but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy . The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states . Both are safe at high doses , but ranitidine is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of cimetidine ."}

Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord . The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla , coinciding with the raphe magnus . In spontaneously hypertensive , stroke - prone rats , microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30 - 40 mm Hg , which was maximal 2 - 3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine ( 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine ) injected intracerebroventricularly . However , intraspinal injection of 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension . Further , 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle , one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells , did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection . It is concluded therefore that , unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa - induced hypotension via descending projections , the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa , either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle , or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem ."}

The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced , and the threshold for action potential generation was increased , indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium channels . In contrast , the conduction velocity , the number and size of axons in the optic nerve , and the specific localization of Na ( v ) 1 . 6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged . beta2 ( - / - ) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures , as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine - induced seizures , but seemed normal in other neurological tests . Our observations show that beta2 - subunits play an important role in the regulation of sodium channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability ."}

OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patients . METHODS : This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation . Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine using enzyme - mediated immunoassay methodology . Plasma samples with benzoylecgonine greater than 150 ng / mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng / mL were defined as positive . Patient demographics , history of underlying drug or alcohol - related seizure disorder , estimated time from seizure to sample collection , history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse , results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse , and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers . RESULTS : Fourteen of 248 ( 5 . 6 % , 95 % CI 2 . 7 % - 8 . 5 % ) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoylecgonine and no samples ( 0 % , 95 % CI 0 - 1 . 2 % ) were positive for amphetamine . Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse ( p < 0 . 0005 ) . CONCLUSIONS : During this study period , routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield . As a result , routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population ."}

The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian ' off ' signs and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( levodopa - induced dyskinesias ) . We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests ( Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations ) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery , whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in levodopa - induced dyskinesias . We also found a highly significant correlation ( P : < 0 . 0001 , r = 0 . 8 ) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in levodopa - induced dyskinesias in the contralateral limbs , whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian ' off ' signs . The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian ' off ' signs . The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and levodopa - induced dyskinesias and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian ' off ' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian ' off ' signs and dyskinesias . Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism , the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of levodopa - induced dyskinesias . We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias , especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy . The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms , and hence could be variable ."}

BACKGROUND : Although an indicator of renal tubular dysfunction , an increased urinary N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells . METHODS : Puromycin aminonucleoside ( Puromycin aminonucleoside ) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria . Total protein , albumin , NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days . The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three , four , six , eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero , four , eight and thirty three . RESULTS : Following intravenous Puromycin aminonucleoside urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two , but returned to normal by day four . After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin , total protein excretion and NAG activity . Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards . Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four . Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets ( day six onwards ) . CONCLUSIONS : This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity , occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells . Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage ."}

Estrogens , which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers , can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats . The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction , during estrogen carcinogenesis , are still unknown . To elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats , the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen ( FVIIIRAg ) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor / vascular permeability factor ( VEGF / VPF ) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis . The expression of VEGF receptor ( VEGFR - 2 / Flk - 1 / KDR ) was also examined by immunohistochemistry . The results demonstrated that 17beta - estradiol ( E2 ) induces neovascularization , as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure . The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF / VPF protein expression in the E2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized ( OVEX ) rats . VEGF / VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin ( UEA1 ) binding studies , indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non - endothelial cells . After 15 days of E2 exposure , VEGF / VPF protein expression , in the non - endothelial cell population , sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels . The function of non - endothelial - derived VEGF is not clear . Furthermore , immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR - 2 ( flk - 1 / KDR ) , expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of E2 exposure . These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor ( VEGFR - 2 ) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of estrogen induced tumor angiogenesis in the rat pituitary ."}

The cardiomyopathy ( cardiomyopathy ) produced by the anticancer drug doxorubicin ( doxorubicin ) ( Adriamycin ) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose - effect and structure - function relationships during development of myocardial disease . We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving doxorubicin . Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative doxorubicin dose between 100 and 600 mg / m2 . Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose , exhibited a curvilinear relationship , and had a \" threshold \" for expression . Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage ( r = 0 . 57 to 0 . 78 ) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured , and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear , threshold configuration . In doxorubicin - cardiomyopathy myocardial damage is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult ( doxorubicin dose ) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached , after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly ."}

We observed no changes in nicotine - induced locomotor response , striatal L - [ 3H ] nicotine and [ 3H ] spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day . In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days , there was a significant increase in the nicotine - stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L - [ 3H ] nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine ( dopamine ) level in the striatum . The number of striatal [ 3H ] spiperone binding sites was not affected . In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days , the nicotine - induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated . However , this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [ 3H ] spiperone binding sites , whereas the number of striatal L - [ 3H ] nicotine binding sites and the striatal dopamine level were normal . These results suggest that chronic nicotine - treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and dopamine concentration , followed by inducing dopamine receptor supersensitivity in the striatum ."}

Cocaine ( 40 mg / kg ) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study . Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group , especially the electrically perturbated subjects . The abnormal behaviors were yawning , retrocollis , hyperactivity , hypersensitivity , \" beating drum \" behavior , squealing , head bobbing , circling , sniffing , abnormal posturing , and facial twitching . Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states . Hypersensitivity to various auditory , tactile , and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation . These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation . Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates . Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated ."}

A hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic study in patients without heart failure . The effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease , but have not been measured previously in man . We assessed the effects of ouabain ( 0 . 015 mg / kg body weight ) on hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure . Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations , we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted . Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain , even though they were initially elevated in only two patients . Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure fell from 11 . 5 + / - 1 . 4 ( mean + / - SE ) to 5 . 6 + / - 0 . 9 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell from 100 + / - 17 to 82 + / - 12 ml / m2 ( P less than 0 . 01 ) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed .

No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients . No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients . We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end - diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal . Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension , and , therefore , of myocardial oxygen consumption , it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption . Nevertheless , compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism ."}

To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between valproic acid - associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity , adult male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated ip with valproic acid ( 500 mg / kg ) or 0 . 9 % saline ( vehicle ) once daily for 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , or 14 days . Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - isoprostane , lipid hydroperoxides ( lipid hydroperoxides ) , and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ) . Plasma and liver 15 - F ( 2t ) - isoprostane were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of valproic acid treatment compared to control . Liver lipid hydroperoxides levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment ( 1 . 8 - fold versus control , p < 0 . 05 ) . Liver and plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were not increased until 14 days ( 2 - fold vs . control , p < 0 . 05 ) . Liver toxicity was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha - glutathione S - transferase ( alpha - GST ) and by histology . Serum alpha - GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4 , which corresponded to hepatotoxicity as shown by the increasing incidence of inflammation of the liver capsule , necrosis , and steatosis throughout the study . The liver levels of beta - oxidation metabolites of valproic acid were decreased by day 14 , while the levels of 4 - ene - valproic acid and ( E ) - 2 , 4 - diene - valproic acid were not elevated throughout the study . Overall , these findings indicate that valproic acid treatment results in oxidative stress , as measured by levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - isoprostane , which precedes the onset of necrosis , steatosis , and elevated levels of serum alpha - GST ."}

{"document_id": "12093990", "title": "12093990", "text": "Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children . BACKGROUND : Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host . The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children , where case fatality rates as high as 50 % to 80 % have been reported . There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease , nor are there any prospective randomized , controlled trials of potentially useful anti - adenovirus therapies . Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series . Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir . Ribavirin , a guanosine analogue , has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses , including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro . Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection , and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C . Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses . The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia . The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects , the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity . OBJECTIVE : We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature . DESIGN / METHODS : We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease . Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants , respectively . The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease . An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia ; 2 were neonates , 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome . The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant . Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate - use protocol . RESULTS : Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children : the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia . The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease . Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated . Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia . DISCUSSION : Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease , namely solid - organ and bone marrow transplant recipients , neonates , and children with immunodeficiency . Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature , therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection . Early identification , eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response . CONCLUSIONS : Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered . The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques , such as polymerase chain reaction , may make earlier , more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible . Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts , especially children , a large , multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti - adenoviral therapies , such as intravenous ribavirin , is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy ."}

The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub - effective doses of ketamine and morphine , administered simultaneously . There was mutual potentiation between sub - effective doses of ketamine and morphine , but sub - effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully - effective doses of morphine .

BACKGROUND : A transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy , most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leukaemia . Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration . METHODS : We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke - like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy . We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data . Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded . RESULTS : We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate ( intrathecal , systemic ) , 5 - fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur , and capecitabine . Diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI ) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum , corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) maps ( available in 21 / 27 patients ) . Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories . Complete resolution of symptoms within 1 - 4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities . However , fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities . CONCLUSIONS : Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed . DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome ."}

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) can progress to cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma , and end - stage liver disease . The current best treatment for hepatitis C virus infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin . Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses ( SVRs ) in approximately 50 % of patients , it can be associated with a potentially dose - limiting hemolytic anemia . Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin - induced hemolysis , and this anemia can be problematic in patients with hepatitis C virus infection , especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders . In general , anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality , and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life .

No malignant lesion was found . Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide . The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously ( 60 and 30 mg , respectively ) , which caused severe hypocalcemia .

OBJECTIVES : Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost - effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha - 2b / ribavirin compared with interferon - alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C ( chronic hepatitis C ) . Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect : ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia ( ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia ) . The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health - care costs and management of ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia during treatment of chronic hepatitis C in a clinical trial setting . METHODS : A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia . Decision - analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia . Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses . RESULTS : ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia , defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g / L , occurs in approximately 7 % to 9 % of patients treated with combination therapy . The standard of care for management of ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage . We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant ribavirin - induced hemolytic anemia to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48 - week treatment course ( range 68 - 692 ) . The results of the one - way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 317 . In comparison , the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16 , 459 .

In the pinealectomized chick , pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia ( DOC ) after ketamine , but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not .

Intra - arterially given PGE2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex , indicating that the prostaglandin had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle . The effect of intra - arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra - arterial RP 67 , 580 or SR 48 , 968 , which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the prostaglandin was given intravesically . The present results thus suggest that intra - arterial PGE2 , given near the bladder , may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor . However , when given intravesically , PGE2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and / or immediately below the urothelium .

In 13 patients we observed the effects of HCTZ therapy ( 100 mg daily ) on the occurrence of PVC ' s during rest as well as during static and dynamic exercise . During rest we observed 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 08 PVC beats / min + / - SEM and during static and dynamic exercise 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 06 and 0 . 8 + / - 0 . 15 , respectively .

The occurrence of PVC ' s correlated significantly with the fall in serum K + observed r = 0 . 72 , p less than 0 . 001 . In conclusion we found that thiazide diuretics cause hypokalemia and depletion of body potassium . The more profound hypokalemia , the greater the propensity for the occurrence of PVC ' s ."}

It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias . If this were so , patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible . Thus , myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium - conserving diuretic ( amiloride ) and a similar period on a potassium - losing diuretic ( chlorthalidone ) in a randomised study . Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol / L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy . Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight , plasma renin and noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens . Compared to amiloride treatment , the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats ( 24 - hour Holter monitoring ) and a higher Lown grading , increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential , prolonged ventricular effective refractory period , and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation . The above results indicate that because potassium - losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease , even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients ."}

CASE : A 49 - year - old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing . On electrocardiogram , episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing ; 24 - hour Holter monitoring recorded several events . The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol , but recurred a year later . The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol . After stopping the beta - agonist , and after a week with the atenolol , the arrhythmia disappeared . DISCUSSION : Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia ( Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia ) is a rare phenomenon . Fewer than 50 cases of Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia have been described in the literature . This article summarizes all the cases published , creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia . It discusses demographics , clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia , postulated mechanisms of Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia , and different treatment possibilities such as medications , surgery , and radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) . CONCLUSION : Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia . Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report , it is logical to think that a beta - agonist like salbutamol ( known to induce tachycardia ) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta - blocker such as atenolol ( that blocks the adrenergic activity ) may relieve it ."}

The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients . Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity . Mitochondrial analysis , respiration intensity , levels of reactive oxygen species , permeability transition , and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration . Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin - mediated acute renal failure . This was accompanied by a lower activity of N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase , together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems . Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration . These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function . We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components ( cytochrome c , NADH ) , probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores . These injuries , partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain , were significantly decreased by metformin . Thus , our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis ."}

OBJECTIVE : To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for hip fracture repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of postoperative delirium . PATIENTS AND METHODS : We performed a double - blind , randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients ( > or = 65 years ) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation . Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index ( BIS ) , and patients were randomized to receive either deep ( BIS , approximately 50 ) or light ( BIS , > or = 80 ) sedation . Postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( Third Edition Revised ) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery . RESULTS : From April 2 , 2005 , through October 30 , 2008 , a total of 114 patients were randomized . The prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group ( 11 / 57 [ 19 % ] vs 23 / 57 [ 40 % ] in the deep sedation group ; P = . 02 ) , indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4 . 7 patients treated with light sedation .

CONCLUSION : The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50 % compared with deep sedation . Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple , safe , and cost - effective intervention for preventing postoperative delirium in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted ."}

METHODS AND RESULTS : In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine ( 3 ' - azido - 2 ' , 3 ' - deoxythymidine ; AZT ) triggers the Fas - dependent cell - death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of Dilated cardiomyopathy , 8 - week - old transgenic ( expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium : FasL Tg ) and non - transgenic ( NTg ) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT ( 0 , 0 . 07 , 0 . 2 , and 0 . 7 mg / ml ) . After 6 weeks , cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods . NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function . In contrast , AZT - treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose - dependent manner , with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles . These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL , as well as increased activation of caspase 3 , translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere , and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis . These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization , as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity .

BACKGROUND : The interruption of oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves , mainly before noncardiac surgery , non - surgical interventions , and pregnancy . Unfractionated heparin ( Unfractionated heparin ) is currently the substitute for selected patients . Low - molecular - weight heparin ( Low - molecular - weight heparin ) offers theoretical advantages over Unfractionated heparin , but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to Unfractionated heparin in patients with prosthetic valves . HYPOTHESIS : The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of Low - molecular - weight heparin in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice . METHODS : For this paper , the current medical literature on Low - molecular - weight heparin in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed . RESULTS : There were eight series and six case reports . None of the studies was randomized , and only one was prospective . Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete . After excluding case reports , the following groups were constructed : ( a ) short - term administration , after valve insertion ( n = 212 ) ; ( b ) short - term , perioperative ( noncardiac ) / periprocedural ( n = 114 ) ; ( c ) long - term , due to intolerance to OAC ( n = 16 ) ; ( d ) long - term , in pregnancy ( n = 10 ) .

OBJECTIVE : Nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin B ( amphotericin B ) , often limiting administration of full dosage . Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with amphotericin B . Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of amphotericin B . This study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on amphotericin B treatment . METHODS : In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous amphotericin B alone or amphotericin B and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection . RESULTS : Patients receiving concomitant amphotericin B and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving amphotericin B alone ( P = 0 . 0027 ) . Those patients receiving amphotericin B and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range ( P = 0 . 022 ) .

Dopamine ( Dopamine ) , through D1 / D2 receptor - mediated signaling , plays a major role in the control of epileptic seizures arising in the limbic system . Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level . In this respect , little is known about the role of Dopamine receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy - induced neuronal cell death . Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R - / - mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine . We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid ( kainic acid ) , a potent glutamate agonist . Importantly , D2R - / - mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity . However , pilocarpine - induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R - / - brains in comparison to kainic acid . Thus , the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine .

Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin . METHODS : The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer . Full visual electrophysiology , including flash electroretinography ( ERG ) , pattern electroretinography , multifocal ERG using the VERIS system , electro - oculography , and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials , was undertaken . RESULTS : Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field . The eighth exhibited concentric constriction . Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits ; two patients had subnormal Arden electro - oculography indices ; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave . However , five patients showed delayed 30 - Hz flicker b waves , and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials . Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level . CONCLUSION : Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy . The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when vigabatrin therapy is withdrawn ."}

BACKGROUND : The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of rapamycin conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine ( CsA ) or tacrolimus ( tacrolimus ) toxicity . METHODS : Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin ( rapamycin ) ( 5 mg / day ) 0 to 204 months posttransplant . Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses . The indications for switch were chronic CsA or tacrolimus nephrotoxicity ( 12 ) , acute CsA or tacrolimus toxicity ( 3 ) , severe facial dysmorphism ( 2 ) , posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ) in remission ( 2 ) , and hepatotoxicity in 1 . Follow - up is 7 to 24 months . RESULTS : In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [ 233 + / - 34 to 210 + / - 56 micromol / liter ( P < 0 . 05 ) at 6 months ] . Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients . No relapse of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder was observed . Five patients developed pneumonia ( two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder lung infiltrate ) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans . There were no deaths . rapamycin was discontinued in four patients , because of pneumonia in two , posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder in one , and oral aphtous ulcers in one . rapamycin levels were high ( > 15 ng / ml ) in 7 of 13 ( 54 % ) patients . CONCLUSIONS : rapamycin conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal . However , when converting patients to rapamycin drug levels should be monitored to avoid over - immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given ."}

The use of adriamycin ( adriamycin ) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity . Earlier observations that adriamycin interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate adriamycin ' s action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb - c mice i . p . treated with adriamycin for several weeks . At various times during treatment , the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy . In parallel , total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady - state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII , COXIII , and COXIV genes . Similarly , samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies . Our results indicated that 1 ) treatment of mice with adriamycin caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia , extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS ) , and failure of QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose ) ; 2 ) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling , fusion , dissolution , and / or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment . Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue ; and 3 ) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined , only COXII gene expression was suppressed by adriamycin treatment , mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver . Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40 % of heart muscle by weight , we conclude that the deteriorating effects of adriamycin on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment ."}

In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) mRNA - containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to seizure - induced damage in a model of chronic seizures . Sprague - Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine , and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine - induced seizures . In situ hybridization histochemistry , using a digoxigenin - labeled GAD cRNA probe , demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the pilocarpine - treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals . Additional neuronanatomical studies , including cresyl violet staining , neuronal degeneration methods , and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein , suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels . The loss of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer . Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals . No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer , which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer . The results indicate that , in this model , a subpopulation of GAD mRNA - containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure - induced damage .

Acute doxorubicin - loaded nanoparticle ( DXNP ) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis . In normal rats , 2 / 6 rats given free doxorubicin ( doxorubicin ) ( 5 mg / kg ) died within one week , whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived . A 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with doxorubicin . Free NP did not provoke any proteinuria . Two hr post - injection , DXNP was 2 . 7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free doxorubicin ( p < 0 . 025 ) . In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis , 5 / 6 rats given doxorubicin died within 7 days , in contrast to animals treated by DXNP , NP , or untreated , which all survived . Proteinuria appeared in all series , but was 2 - 5 times more intense ( p > 0 . 001 ) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment ( 400 - 700 mg / day ) , without significant difference between DXNP and doxorubicin . Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls . These results demonstrate that , in these experimental conditions , DXNP killed less animals than free doxorubicin , despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former . Both effects ( better survival and nephrosis ) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system , including mesangial cells ."}

This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were due to nephrotic syndrome per se , or , at least in part , to the aminonucleoside . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside ( 20 mg / kg for 7 days ) and the subsequent development of nephrotic syndrome . Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment , the time - course study was divided into two stages : pre - nephrotic stage ( day 1 - 5 ) and nephrotic stage ( day 6 - 11 ) . In pre - nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty acids , triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid , cholesteryl esters and HDL remained constant . Plasma apolipoprotein A - I tended to increase ( 40 % increase at day 5 ) . At the beginning of nephrotic stage ( day 6 ) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level , while that of apolipoprotein A - I increased abruptly ( 4 - fold increase ) and continued to rise , although less steeply , in the following days . The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern . Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage ( day 9 ) . Plasma apolipoprotein A - I was found not only in HDL ( 1 . 063 - 1 . 210 g / ml ) but also in the LDL density class ( 1 . 025 - 1 . 050 g / ml ) . In the pre - nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible , while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL . These observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL . It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism ."}

In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion , on amphetamine - induced rotational behavior . Three days post lesion , most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion . Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration - induced breakdown of the DA pool , or lesion - induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons . A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning , indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation . However , regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume , amphetamine dose , or post - lesion motor exercise ) , amphetamine - induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed , and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections .

Using a rat model of adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy , we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose - dependently in adriamycin cardiomyopathy . The degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment ( 2 mg / kg , once a week ) . There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1 - or 2 - wk treatment groups , isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3 - wk group , frequent scattered degeneration in the 4 - wk group , scattered or focal degeneration in the 5 - wk group , and extensive degeneration in the 8 - wk group . Myocardial accumulation of [ 125I ] metaiodobenzylguanidine 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less . However , the 4 - wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall ( 82 % of the control ) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall ( about 66 % of the control : p less than 0 . 05 ) .

BACKGROUND : Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks , including hypercalcemia and / or marked suppression of bone turnover , which may lead to adynamic bone disease . A new vitamin D analogue , 22 - oxacalcitriol ( 22 - oxacalcitriol ) , has been shown to have promising characteristics . This study was undertaken to determine the effects of 22 - oxacalcitriol on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function . METHODS : Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized ( Nx , N = 38 ) or sham - operated ( Sham , N = 22 ) . The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion . Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation , half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of 22 - oxacalcitriol ( three times per week ) ; the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks . Thereafter , the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months . Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study , and bone biopsies were done at baseline , 60 weeks after 22 - oxacalcitriol or vehicle treatment , and at the end of the crossover period . RESULTS : In Nx dogs , 22 - oxacalcitriol significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency . In long - standing secondary hyperparathyroidism , 22 - oxacalcitriol ( 0 . 03 microg / kg ) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months . Serum PTH levels rose thereafter , but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control . These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia . In animals with normal renal function , 22 - oxacalcitriol induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0 . 1 microg / kg , which was not sustained with lowering of the doses . In Nx dogs , 22 - oxacalcitriol reversed abnormal bone formation , such as woven osteoid and fibrosis , but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover . In addition , 22 - oxacalcitriol improved mineralization lag time , ( that is , the rate at which osteoid mineralizes ) in both Nx and Sham dogs . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that even though 22 - oxacalcitriol does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency , it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and , therefore , does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease ."}

BACKGROUND : Hypotension is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant overdose . Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit calcium influx in some tissues . This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant - induced hypotension . METHODS : Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker overdose . CaCl2 and 4 - aminopyridine . Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP to produce hypotension , QRS prolongation , and bradycardia . Fifteen min later , animals received CaCl2 , NaHCO3 , or saline . In a second experiment , rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP followed in 15 min by 4 - aminopyridine or saline . RESULTS : NaHCO3 briefly ( 5 min ) reversed hypotension and QRS prolongation . CaCl2 and 4 - aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure . The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias ( p = 0 . 004 ) and seizures ( p = 0 . 03 ) in the CaCl2 group was higher than the other groups . CONCLUSION : The administration of CaCl2 or 4 - aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant - induced hypotension in rats . CaCl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity . These findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant - induced hypotension ."}

PURPOSE : Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with 13 - cis - retinoic acid ( 13 - cis - retinoic acid ) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation . Since 13 - cis - retinoic acid has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients , it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy . This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal - tolerated dosage ( MTD ) , toxicities , and pharmacokinetics of 13 - cis - retinoic acid administered on an intermittent schedule in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Fifty - one assessable patients , 2 to 12 years of age , were treated with oral 13 - cis - retinoic acid administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks , followed by a 2 - week rest period , for up to 12 courses . The dose was escalated from 100 to 200 mg / m2 / d until dose - limiting toxicity ( DLT ) was observed . A single intrapatient dose escalation was permitted . RESULTS : The MTD of 13 - cis - retinoic acid was 160 mg / m2 / d . Dose - limiting toxicities in six of nine patients at 200 mg / m2 / d included hypercalcemia ( n = 3 ) , rash ( n = 2 ) , and anemia / thrombocytopenia / emesis / rash ( n = 1 ) . All toxicities resolved after 13 - cis - retinoic acid was discontinued . Three complete responses were observed in marrow metastases . Serum levels of 7 . 4 + / - 3 . 0 mumol / L ( peak ) and 4 . 0 + / - 2 . 8 mumol / L ( trough ) at the MTD were maintained during 14 days of therapy . The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol / L . CONCLUSION : The MTD of 13 - cis - retinoic acid given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg / m2 / d . Serum levels known to be effective against neuroblastoma in vitro were achieved at this dose . The DLT included hypercalcemia , and may be predicted by serum 13 - cis - retinoic acid levels . Monitoring of serum calcium and 13 - cis - retinoic acid levels is indicated in future trials ."}

Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during atrial fibrillation . RESULTS : Verapamil caused atrial fibrillation promotion in six dogs , increasing mean duration of atrial fibrillation induced by burst pacing , from 8 + / - 4 s ( mean + / - S . E . ) to 95 + / - 39 s ( P < 0 . 01 vs . control ) at a loading dose of 0 . 1 mg / kg and 228 + / - 101 s ( P < 0 . 0005 vs . control ) at a dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg . Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil . In these experiments , verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period ( ERP ) from 122 + / - 5 to 114 + / - 4 ms ( P < 0 . 02 ) at a cycle length of 300 ms , decreased ERP heterogeneity ( from 15 + / - 1 to 10 + / - 1 % , P < 0 . 05 ) , heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of atrial fibrillation ( 94 + / - 4 to 84 + / - 3 ms , P < 0 . 005 ) . Diltiazem did not affect ERP , atrial fibrillation cycle length or atrial fibrillation duration , but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil ( n = 5 ) . In the presence of autonomic blockade , verapamil failed to promote atrial fibrillation and increased , rather than decreasing , refractoriness . Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade . Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted atrial fibrillation by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle . CONCLUSIONS : Verapamil promotes atrial fibrillation in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry , an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem ."}

Recently , we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of nicotinic acid amide , a selective inhibitor of poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ; EC 2 . 4 . 2 . 30 ) on mice suffering from acetaminophen ( acetaminophen ) - hepatitis , suggesting that the acetaminophen - induced liver injury involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation . The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of NAD , the substrate on which PARP acts , in female NMRI mice with acetaminophen hepatitis and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals . Liver injuries were quantified as serum activities of glutamate - oxaloacetate transaminase ( GOT ) and glutamate - pyruvate transaminase ( GPT ) . While acetaminophen caused a 117 - fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet , which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by nicotinic acid amide ( nicotinic acid amide ) , adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of NAD . In these animals , only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of acetaminophen , and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a standard diet , the liver damage was inhibited by 50 % by ethanol . A further 64 % reduction of hepatitis was observed , when nicotinic acid amide was given to ethanol / acetaminophen - mice . Our results provide evidence that the acetaminophen - induced hepatitis and its exacerbation by ethanol can either be reduced by end - product inhibition of PARP by nicotinic acid amide or by dietary depletion of the enzyme ' s substrate NAD . We see the main application of nicotinic acid amide as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of acetaminophen in order to avoid hepatic damage in patients treated with this widely used analgesic ."}

BACKGROUND : More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith ( 1973 ) reported on the devastation caused by alcohol exposure on fetal development , the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged . Early identification of fetal alcohol exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes . This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting alcohol - related fetal growth impairment . METHODS : We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention study . The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies . Because intensity of alcohol consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes , separate analyses were conducted for the heavy ( average of > or = 5 drinks per drinking day ) alcohol consumers . Fetal measures from the heavy - exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal , uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics . Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and drug abuse . RESULTS : Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies . When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies , fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non - alcohol - exposed group , regardless of prior drinking patterns . Any alcohol consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers . Amphetamine abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios . CONCLUSIONS : Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies . Although the reliance on self - reported drinking is a limitation in this study , these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal alcohol effects ."}

METHODS : We screened patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites . Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter . Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made . RESULTS : Thirteen patients with positive cocaine toxicology were compared to 26 controls . There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid , sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral , precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral , or basilar arteries ( p greater than 0 . 05 for all comparisons , unpaired t - tests ) .

This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead - induced hypertension is , in part , due to depressed NO synthase ( NOS ) expression . Male Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead - treated group ( given lead acetate , 100 ppm , in drinking water and regular rat chow ) , a group given lead and vitamin E - fortified chow , or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin E - fortified food for 12 weeks . Tail blood pressure , urinary NOx excretion , plasma malondialdehyde ( malondialdehyde ) , and endothelial and inducible NOS ( eNOS and iNOS ) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured . The lead - treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma malondialdehyde concentration , a fall in urinary NOx excretion , and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression . Vitamin E supplementation ameliorated hypertension , lowered plasma malondialdehyde concentration , and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular , but not renal , tissue eNOS and iNOS expression . Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure , plasma malondialdehyde , or NOS expression in the control group . The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by lead in cell - free preparations . In conclusion , lead - induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression . This is , in part , due to ROS - mediated NO inactivation , lead - associated inhibition of NOS activity , and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension ."}

BACKGROUND : The most striking of carboplatin ' s advantages ( CBDCA ) over cisplatin ( CDDP ) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects . However , the use of CBDCA higher - intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Two different schedules of CBDCA administration ( 10 mg / kg and 15 mg / kg i . p . twice a week for nine times ) were evaluated in Wistar rats . Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral ( tail - flick test ) , neurophysiological ( nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve ) , morphological , morphometrical and analytical effects . RESULTS : CBDCA administration induced dose - dependent peripheral neurotoxicity . Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired , particularly after the high - dose treatment . The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and , to a lesser extent , satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP , mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons . Moreover , significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment . CONCLUSIONS : CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model , and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism . This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of CBDCA on the peripheral nervous system ."}

Since tamoxifen is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer , its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined . We have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case - control study . Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer ( n = 135 ) and 467 controls matched for age , year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included . Women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not ( crude relative risk = 4 . 9 , p = 0 . 0001 ) . Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment ( p = 0 . 0001 ) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received ( p = 0 . 0001 ) , irrespective of the daily dose . Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk ( crude relative risk = 7 . 8 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .

OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluoxetine given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused hyperprolactinemia and its effects with respect to adenomyosis . DESIGN : Fluoxetine , a serotonin reuptake inhibitor , was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce hyperprolactinemia . The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls . Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days . SETTING : Marmara University School of Medicine , Department of Histology and Embryology , Zeynep Kamil Women and Children ' s Hospital . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Serum prolactin levels , uterine histopathology . RESULTS : The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with fluoxetine were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups . Histological studies revealed 11 cases of adenomyosis , all within the noncastrated group receiving fluoxetine . CONCLUSION : It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian steroids that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma . This invasion eventually progresses to adenomyosis ."}

OBJECTIVE : The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia on trabecular bone mineral density ( BMD ) in children and adolescents . METHOD : Medically healthy 7 - to 17 - year - old males chronically treated , in a naturalistic setting , with risperidone were recruited for this cross - sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007 . Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted . The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review , and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record . Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography , and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry . RESULTS : Hyperprolactinemia was present in 49 % of 83 boys ( n = 41 ) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2 . 9 years . Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia . As expected , bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity . After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores , serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius ( P < . 03 ) . Controlling for relevant covariates , we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius ( P = . 03 ) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine ( P < . 05 ) . These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non - Hispanic white patients . Of 13 documented fractures , 3 occurred after risperidone and SSRIs were started , and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia . CONCLUSIONS : This is the first study to link risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents . Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues ."}

METHODS : Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years . Patients ' , who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR , were identified . Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument .

BACKGROUND : Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant ; however , it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro . These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis . OBJECTIVE : The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease . DESIGN : We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease ( n = 281 ) , coronary artery disease ( n = 175 ) , and stroke ( n = 57 ) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline . Diet was assessed with a food - frequency questionnaire at baseline , and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y . RESULTS : After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors , type of diabetes medication used , duration of diabetes , and intakes of folate , vitamin E , and beta - carotene , the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1 . 0 , 0 . 97 , 1 . 11 , 1 . 47 , and 1 . 84 ( P for trend < 0 . 01 ) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements .

A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) of lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days . As observed with different doses , the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain . Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1 / 1A2 , 2B1 / 2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes . In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD , EROD and NDMA - d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1 / 2B2 , 1A1 / 1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes , respectively .

After 5 weeks of bupropion use , the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence . The patient had no other risk factors for seizures . We suggest that sleep deprivation may add to the risk of bupropion - associated seizures ."}

BACKGROUND : The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy . Whether iso - osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low - osmolar contrast medium in high - risk patients is uncertain . METHODS : We conducted a randomized , double - blind , prospective , multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso - osmolar , dimeric , nonionic contrast medium , iodixanol , with those of a low - osmolar , nonionic , monomeric contrast medium , iohexol . The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1 . 5 to 3 . 5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography . The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography . Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more , an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or more , and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 . RESULTS : The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol . From day 0 to day 3 , the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0 . 13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0 . 55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group ( P = 0 . 001 ; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol , - 0 . 42 mg per deciliter [ 95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 73 to - 0 . 22 ] ) . Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group ( 3 percent ) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more , as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group ( 26 percent ) ( P = 0 . 002 ; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group , 0 . 09 [ 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 02 to 0 . 41 ] ) . No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or more , but 10 patients in the iohexol group ( 15 percent ) did . The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0 . 07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0 . 24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group ( P = 0 . 003 ; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group , - 0 . 17 mg per deciliter [ 95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 34 to - 0 . 07 ] ) . CONCLUSIONS : Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high - risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low - osmolar , nonionic contrast medium ."}

Using a positron emission tomography ( PET ) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state , but not in the headache free interval . It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called ' migraine generator ' . To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers , using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients . A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve . Increases of regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) were found bilaterally in the insula , in the anterior cingulate cortex , the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum . Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state . The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however , suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such , rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache ."}

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia .

The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dosages . With this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms , it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be lowered . A 73 - year - old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone . The syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine . It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome ."}

Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated . Thus , caffeine ( 3 . 3 mg / kg ) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men ( aged 20 to 35 years ) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions . Borderline hypertensive men ( n = 24 ) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure ( BP ) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and / or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg . Low - risk controls ( n = 24 ) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening BP < 130 / 85 mm Hg . Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12 - hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols ; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits . Caffeine - induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls ( + 8 . 4 vs + 3 . 8 mm Hg , p < 0 . 0001 ) , and were attributable to larger changes in impedance - derived measures of systemic vascular resistance ( + 135 vs + 45 dynes . s . cm - 5 , p < 0 . 004 ) . These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols . The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96 % . Consequently , whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline , 33 % of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion . Thus , in borderline hypertensive men , exaggerated responses to caffeine were : selective for diastolic BP , consistent with greater vasoconstriction , replicated in 2 protocols , and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives . We suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression , as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment ."}

BACKGROUND : Hallucinations as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of ifosfamide . Most cases of ifosfamide - induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes . METHODS : The authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide - induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium . All patients were receiving high - dose ifosfamide as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure . RESULTS : Hallucinations occurred only when the patient ' s eyes were closed and , in all but one case , were reported as disturbing or frightening . Underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely . CONCLUSIONS : Hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity . The incidence may be dose and infusion - time related . The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide - induced hallucinations , which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity . \" Eyes - closed \" hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation .

CB 3717 , N10 - propargyl - 5 , 8 - dideazafolic acid , is a tight - binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme . Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of CB 3717 polyglutamates . Following a 12 - hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [ 3H ] CB 3717 , 30 % of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as CB 3717 tetra - and pentaglutamate , as determined by high - pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analyses . As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS , CB 3717 di - , tri - , tetra - and pentaglutamate are 26 - , 87 - , 119 - and 114 - fold more potent than CB 3717 , respectively , and their formation may , therefore , be an important determinant of CB 3717 cytotoxicity . In early clinical studies with CB 3717 , activity has been seen in breast cancer , ovarian cancer , hepatoma , and mesothelioma . Toxicities included hepatotoxicity , malaise , and dose - limiting nephrotoxicity . This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of CB 3717 under acidic conditions . In an attempt to overcome this problem , a clinical trial of CB 3717 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way . Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg / m2 suggest that a reduction in nephrotoxicity may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients . Hepatotoxicity and malaise are again the most frequent side effects . Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients . Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter CB 3717 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved ."}

In a 12 - week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients . Ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine , their previous antiparkinsonian drug . However , benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment , and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients . This suggests that benztropine is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic - induced parkinsonian symptoms , because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect ."}

In the study presented here , we investigated the use of dexamethasone in combination with mesna for the prevention of ifosfamide - induced Hemorrhagic cystitis . METHODS : Male Wistar rats ( 150 - 200 g ; 6 rats per group ) were treated with saline or mesna 5 min ( i . p . ) before and 2 and 6 h after ( v . o . ) administration of ifosfamide . One , two or three doses of mesna were replaced with dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone plus mesna . Cystitis was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis . RESULTS : The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by ifosfamide by 84 . 79 % and 89 . 13 % , respectively . In addition , it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by ifosfamide . Moreover , the addition of dexamethasone to the last two doses of mesna was more efficient than three doses of mesna alone when evaluated microscopically .

The effects of dizocilpine ( MK - 801 ) , a noncompetitive N - methyl - D - aspartate ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) receptor antagonist , were studied on dopamine - related behaviors induced by reserpine treatments . This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson ' s disease , or tardive dyskinesia , and its response after glutamatergic blockage . Reserpine ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered once every other day for 4 days , produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia , tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice , which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia . Reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy , which are signs suggestive of Parkinson ' s disease . MK - 801 ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) , administered 30 min before the observation test , prevented the vacuous chewing movements , tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by reserpine . However , MK - 801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine - treated mice . Reserpine ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) 5 min before the test , did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice . On the other hand , reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice . MK - 801 ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine . Pretreatment with reserpine ( 1 mg / kg ) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion , as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy , whereas MK - 801 ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine . These results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal movements , which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian - like and tardive dsykinesia signs .

OBJECTIVE : In this study the effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the prostigmine - morphine - induced sphincter of Oddi spasm was evaluated in nine female patients with sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia . METHOD : Sphincter of Oddi spasm was induced by prostigmine - morphine administration ( 0 . 5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously ) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy . The entire procedure was repeated during glyceryl trinitrate infusion ( Nitrolingual 1 microg / kg / min for 120 min ) . RESULTS : Prostigmine - morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity ( Tmax ) over the hepatic hilum ( HH : 34 . 33 + / - 5 . 05 vs . 22 . 77 + / - 3 . 26 ) and the common bile duct ( CBD : 60 . 44 + / - 5 . 99 vs . 40 . 0 + / - 2 . 88 ) and in the half - time of excretion ( T1 / 2 ) over the liver parenchyma ( LP : 120 . 04 + / - 16 . 01 vs . 27 . 37 + / - 2 . 19 ) , HH ( 117 . 61 + / - 14 . 71 vs . 31 . 85 + / - 3 . 99 ) and CBD ( 158 . 11 + / - 9 . 18 vs . 40 . 1 + / - 6 . 24 ) , indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi . Glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely normalized the prostigmine - morphine - induced alterations in these quantitative parameters ( TmaX over the LP : 11 . 33 + / - 1 . 13 ; over the HH : 18 . 88 + / - 1 . 48 ; and over the CBD : 36 . 22 + / - 1 . 92 ; and T1 / 2 over the LP : 28 . 21 + / - 1 . 83 ; over the HH : 33 . 42 + / - 3 . 10 ; and over the CBD : 41 . 66 + / - 6 . 33 ) , suggesting an effective sphincter - relaxing effect of glyceryl trinitrate . CONCLUSION : These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine - induced sphincter of Oddi spasm in humans .

Occasional case reports have shown that acute myopathy may occur in patients treated with massive doses of corticosteroids . The mechanism of this myopathy is poorly understood . Therefore , 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline ( C ) , methylprednisolone ( methylprednisolone ) , or triamcinolone ( triamcinolone ) 80 mg / kg / d for 5 d . Nutritional intake , measured daily in 15 animals , showed a significant reduction of food intake in the steroid - treated groups ( - 50 and - 79 % in methylprednisolone and triamcinolone , respectively ) . This was associated with a similar loss in body weight . In the 45 remaining animals , diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied . Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after steroid treatment . Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group ( 653 + / - 174 g / cm ( 2 ) ) than in the methylprednisolone group ( 837 + / - 171 g / cm ( 2 ) ; p < 0 . 05 ) and the triamcinolone group ( 765 + / - 145 g / cm ( 2 ) , NS ) . Half - relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups , and time to peak tension was longer with methylprednisolone , whereas tetanic tensions were similar . Steroid treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force - frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment ( p < 0 . 05 ) . ATPase staining of the diaphragm , scalenus medius , and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa atrophy with triamcinolone , whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis . Finally , a pair - fed ( PF ) study , performed in 18 rats ( C , triamcinolone , and PF ) , showed that muscle atrophy was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in triamcinolone - treated animals . We conclude that ( 1 ) short - term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting ; ( 2 ) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb atrophy , resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties ; ( 3 ) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis ; ( 4 ) type IIb atrophy was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone ."}

Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs , notably methotrexate . However , the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities . Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration , i . e . for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose . This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation . Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities . There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation . Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance . The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor .

BACKGROUND : Hemolytic anemia is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin . Because of ribavirin - related hemolytic anemia , dose reduction is a common event in this therapy . In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy . METHODS : Thirty - seven of 160 patients who had HCV - genotype 1b , had high virus load , and received 24 - week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level < 10 g / dl or anemia - related signs during therapy . After that , these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin ( 200 mg ) per day . After reduction of ribavirin , 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks ( group A ) . However , 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their < 8 . 5 g / dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia - related severe side effects occurred ( group B ) . We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups A and B . RESULTS : A sustained virological response ( SVR ) was 29 . 6 % ( 8 / 27 ) in group A and 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group B , respectively .

Nephrotic syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized edema . However , the molecular basis for the decreased renal sodium excretion remains undefined . We hypothesized that epithelial Na channel ( ENaC ) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium retention . An experimental group of rats was treated with puromycin aminonucleoside ( puromycin aminonucleoside ; 180 mg / kg iv ) , whereas the control group received only vehicle . After 7 days , puromycin aminonucleoside treatment induced significant proteinuria , hypoalbuminemia , decreased urinary sodium excretion , and extensive ascites . The protein abundance of alpha - ENaC and beta - ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla ( ISOM ) and in the inner medulla ( IM ) but was not altered in the cortex . gamma - ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex , ISOM , and IM . Immunoperoxidase brightfield - and laser - scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha - ENaC , beta - ENaC , and gamma - ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT2 ) , connecting tubule , and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments . Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha - ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of puromycin aminonucleoside - treated rats , indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha - ENaC subunits . In contrast , the protein abundances of Na ( + ) / H ( + ) exchanger type 3 ( NHE3 ) , Na ( + ) - K ( + ) - 2Cl ( - ) cotransporter ( BSC - 1 ) , and thiazide - sensitive Na ( + ) - Cl ( - ) cotransporter ( TSC ) were decreased . Moreover , the abundance of the alpha ( 1 ) - subunit of the Na - K - ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM , but it remained unchanged in the IM . In conclusion , the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2 , connecting tubule , and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN - induced nephrotic syndrome . The decreased abundance of NHE3 , BSC - 1 , TSC , and Na - K - ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion ."}

BACKGROUND : In recent studies increased amounts of nitric oxide ( nitric oxide ) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney . We have studied the role of nitric oxide and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin ( adriamycin ) . METHODS : The alteration in the nitric oxide pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum / urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney ( IPRK ) system . Rats were stratified into control groups and adriamycin - induced nephropathy groups . These two groups were then divided into : group 1 , animals receiving saline ; and group 2 , animals receiving aminoguanidine ( aminoguanidine ) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible - nitric oxide synthase . On day 21 , rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis . RESULTS : Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with adriamycin revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation . They also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the adriamycin - nephropathy group ( P < 0 . 05 ) . In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the adriamycin - nephropathy group . Apoptosis was not detected in controls . However , in the adriamycin - nephropathy group , numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas . Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1 , a marker for monocytes / macrophages . Treatment with aminoguanidine prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control levels . CONCLUSION : We suggest that interactions between nitric oxide and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the adriamycin - induced nephrosis ."}

It is known that beta - adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of akathisia , one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment . Neuroleptic - induced catalepsy , a model of neuroleptic - induced extrapyramidal side effects , was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic - induced akathisia in humans , although neuroleptic - induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic - induced akathisia . Therefore , the effects of carteolol , a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist , on haloperidol - induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden , a muscarinic receptor antagonist . Carteolol , as well as propranolol and biperiden , inhibited the haloperidol - induced catalepsy . The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol , but was weaker than that of biperiden . Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats . Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine - induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats . In addition , carteolol did not evoke 5 - HT1A receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5 - hydroxytryptophan - induced head twitch in rats . Finally , carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine - induced lethality in rats . These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol - induced catalepsy via its beta - adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without attenuating neuroleptic - induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity ."}

Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the convulsive , lethal , locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of cocaine in mice . In contrast , the contribution of sigma2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are unavailable . To begin addressing this need , we characterized UMB24 ( 1 - ( 2 - phenethyl ) - 4 - ( 2 - pyridyl ) - piperazine ) and ( + / - ) - SM 21 ( 3alpha - tropanyl - 2 - ( 4 - chorophenoxy ) butyrate ) in receptor binding and behavioral studies . Receptor binding studies confirmed that UMB24 and ( + / - ) - SM 21 display preferential affinity for sigma2 over sigma1 receptors . In behavioral studies , pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with UMB24 or ( + / - ) - SM 21 significantly attenuated cocaine - induced convulsions and locomotor activity , but not lethality . When administered alone , ( + / - ) - SM 21 produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline , but UMB24 had locomotor depressant actions . Together , the data suggest that sigma2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of cocaine , and further development of more selective , high affinity ligands are warranted ."}

An antibody response to a protein - bound biotransformation product ( trifluoroacetyl adduct ) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients . This study was performed to determine cross - reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane . The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane - induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane , and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models . Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver . In the same liver , biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20 - fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats . This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and / or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration .

The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical , considering the current evidence of a pulmonary hypertension protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the fluoxetine effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate . METHODS : Pregnant rats were treated with fluoxetine ( 10 mg / kg ) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section . As compared with controls , fluoxetine exposure resulted in fetal pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum ( P = 0 . 02 ) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness ( P < 0 . 01 ) .

BACKGROUND : Methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts to decrease illicit opioid use . Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes ( torsade de pointes ) has been reported in methadone users . As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs , doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of torsade de pointes in this special population , and the high mortality in this population may , in part , be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone . METHODS : In this cross - sectional study interview , ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult heroin addicts treated with methadone or buprenorphine on a daily basis . Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen , 450 ( approximately 52 % ) were included . The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs . All participants were interviewed about any experience of syncope . The association between opioid dose and QT , and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression , respectively . RESULTS : Methadone dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0 . 140 ms / mg ( p = 0 . 002 ) . No association between buprenorphine and QTc was found .

Acute nephrotoxicity , which occurs in the early period after transplantation , leads to a higher rate of dialysis , and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss . Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases . Two recently available immunosuppressive agents , mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus ( recently available immunosuppressive agents , mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus ) , have no nephrotoxicity .

Anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin ( 50 mg / kg i . v . ) resulting in a long - lasting reduction ( 30 % ) of the hemoglobin concentration . In a second group , the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO ( 1000 IU / kg ) administered s . c . three times / week starting 7 days before carboplatin application . Four days after carboplatin treatment , tumors ( DS - sarcoma of the rat ) were implanted s . c . onto the hind food dorsum . Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se . When tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg / kg i . p . ) 5 days after implantation , a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed . In the anemia group , the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days versus 8 . 6 days ) . In the group where anemia was prevented by rHuEPO treatment , growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days ) . These results suggest that chemotherapy - induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors , whereas correction of anemia by rHuEPO treatment ( epoetin alpha ) increases the sensitivity , probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue ."}

STUDY OBJECTIVE : To determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing with technetium - 99m sestamibi single - photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST - segment monitoring , and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol ' s effects . DESIGN : Randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial . SETTING : Community hospital . PATIENTS : Twenty - two patients with known reversible perfusion defects . INTERVENTION : Patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol . Before dobutamine was begun , no therapy was given during the first visit , and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg . Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats / minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31 % , summed stress scores 29 % , and summed difference scores 43 % versus control . Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29 % versus control . Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced , although they were 18 % and 30 % lower , respectively , than control . No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol - glucagon . CONCLUSION : During dobutamine stress testing , metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia . Glucagon 1 mg , although somewhat effective , does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically ."}

Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood . We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of prednisolone on muscle function and pharmacology , and their relationship to changes in muscle size and acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) expression . With institutional approval , 35 Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg / kg prednisolone ( P10 group ) , 100 mg / kg prednisolone ( P100 group ) , or an equal volume of saline ( S group ) for 7 days . A fourth group of rats was pair fed ( food restricted ) with the P100 rats for 7 days ( FR group ) . On Day 8 , the nerve - evoked peak twitch tensions , tetanic tensions , and fatigability , and the dose - response curves of d - tubocurarine in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs . Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P100 , FR , and P10 groups compared with the S group . Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups . The evoked peak twitch and tetanic tensions were less in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups , however , tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P100 group than in the S group . The 50 % effective dose of d - tubocurarine ( microg / kg ) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 ( 33 . 6 + / - 5 . 4 ) than in the S ( 61 . 9 + / - 5 . 0 ) or the P100 ( 71 . 3 + / - 9 . 6 ) groups . AChR expression was less in the P10 group than in the S group . The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass ( r ( 2 ) = 0 . 32 , P < 0 . 001 ) , however , not with expression of AChR . The 50 % effective dose of d - tubocurarine did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression . Our results suggest that the neuromuscular dysfunction after prednisolone is dose - dependent , and derives primarily from muscle atrophy and derives less so from changes in AChR expression . IMPLICATIONS : The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear .

The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion ( TDI ) of iron dextran has been well documented . In 40 % of treated patients , an arthralgia - myalgia syndrome develops . The purpose of this randomized , double - blind , prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous ( i . v . ) administration of methylprednisolone ( methylprednisolone ) prevents this complication . Sixty - five patients , 34 women and 31 men , ages 36 to 80 years , received either normal saline before and after TDI ( group 1 ) , 125 mg i . v . methylprednisolone before and saline after TDI ( group 2 ) , or 125 mg i . v . methylprednisolone before and after TDI ( group 3 ) . Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity . Fifty - eight percent of group 1 patients , 33 % of group 2 , and 26 % of group 3 had reactions to TDI . The severity of reactions ( minimal , mild , and moderate , respectively ) was as follows : group 1 - - 6 , 6 , and 2 ; group 2 - - 1 , 5 , and 0 ; group 3 - - 5 , 1 , and 0 . Data were analyzed by the two - sided Fisher ' s exact test using 95 % confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf . These data demonstrate that administration of methylprednisolone before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the arthralgia - myalgia syndrome .

Wistar rats ( 180 g ) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2 , 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis .

MATERIAL AND METHODS : Twenty - five Sprague - Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes . In group - 1 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group - 2 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was on ( 185 Hz , 0 . 5V , 1V , 2V , and 5V for 60 sec ) following penicillin G injection intracortically .

It is widely believed that dopamine ( dopamine ) mediates methamphetamine ( methamphetamine ) - induced toxicity to brain dopaminergic neurons , because drugs that interfere with dopamine neurotransmission decrease toxicity , whereas drugs that increase dopamine neurotransmission enhance toxicity . However , temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain dopamine neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data . Here we show that the recently reported ability of L - dihydroxyphenylalanine to reverse the protective effect of alpha - methyl - para - tyrosine on methamphetamine - induced dopamine neurotoxicity is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature . Further , we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain dopamine develop methamphetamine neurotoxicity , as long as the thermic effects of methamphetamine are preserved . In addition , we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain dopamine deficits develop methamphetamine - induced dopaminergic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain .

OBJECTIVE : Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure , which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis . Here , we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients , a streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2 ( - / - ) mice , and cultured human mesangial cells . RESULTS : The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels . In the animal study , Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin - induced renal damage . This is evident by Nrf2 ( - / - ) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2 ( + / + ) mice . Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2 - mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is , at least , partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 ) and reduction of extracellular matrix production . In human renal mesangial cells , high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes . Furthermore , activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF - beta1 in a dose - dependent manner , whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF - beta1 transcription and fibronectin production . CONCLUSIONS : This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy , suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy ."}

BACKGROUND : In 2 separate centers , we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1 . 3 % to 3 . 8 % in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures . These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high - dose tranexamic acid ( tranexamic acid ) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage . The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between tranexamic acid usage and seizures after cardiac surgery . METHODS : An in - depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures . Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients , and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies . RESULTS : Twenty - one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury , but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients . All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities . All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of tranexamic acid intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg / kg , had a mean age of 69 . 9 years , and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures . All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass . No evidence of brain ischemic , metabolic , or hyperthermia - induced causes for their seizures was apparent .

Based on 290 subjects , there was an average difference of 0 . 50 dB between subjects treated with difluoromethylornithine plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo ( 95 % confidence interval , - 0 . 64 to 1 . 63 dB ; P = 0 . 39 ) , adjusted for baseline values , age , and frequencies . In the normal speech range of 500 to 3 , 000 Hz , an estimated difference of 0 . 99 dB ( - 0 . 17 to 2 . 14 dB ; P = 0 . 09 ) was detected . Dose intensity did not add information to models . There were 14 of 151 ( 9 . 3 % ) in the difluoromethylornithine plus sulindac group and 4 of 139 ( 2 . 9 % ) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested ( P = 0 . 02 ) . Follow - up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1 . 08 dB ( - 0 . 81 to 2 . 96 dB ; P = 0 . 26 ) between treatment arms . There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the difluoromethylornithine plus sulindac group who experienced clinically significant hearing loss compared with the placebo group . The estimated attributable risk of ototoxicity from exposure to the drug is 8 . 4 % ( 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 0 % to 18 . 8 % ; P = 0 . 12 ) . There is a < 2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with difluoromethylornithine plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo ."}

OBJECTIVES : The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon4 and subjective effects of trihexyphenidyl on measures reflecting sedation and confusion and to investigate the relationship between trihexyphenidyl - induced subjective effects and objective memory performance . METHODS : This study comprised 24 cognitively intact , health elderly adults ( 12 APOE epsilon4 carriers ) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic . This was a randomized , double blind , placebo - controlled , three - way , crossover experimental design . All participants received 1 . 0 mg or 2 . 0 mg trihexyphenidyl or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks . Bond and Lader ' s visual analog scales and alternate versions of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline , 1 , 2 . 5 , and 5 hours postdrug administration . RESULTS : A 2 . 0 - mg oral dose of trihexyphenidyl resulted in increased subjective ratings of mental slowness in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only . Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2 . 0 mg trihexyphenidyl and placebo on ratings of mental slowness significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only . However , no significant effects were found with other visual analog scales reflecting subjective sedation and clear - headedness . CONCLUSION : The epsilon4 allele in healthy elderly was associated with increased subjective mental slowing after trihexyphenidyl anticholinergic challenge ."}

The goal of this study was to assess the interactive effects of chronic anabolic androgenic steroid ( AAS ) exposure and brain serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine , 5 - HT ) depletion on behavior of pubertal male rats . Serotonin was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine ( PCPA 100 mg / kg , every other day ) ; controls received saline . At puberty ( P40 ) , half the PCPA - treated rats and half the saline - treated rats began treatment with testosterone ( testosterone , 5 mg / kg , 5 days / week ) . Behavioral measures included locomotion , irritability , copulation , partner preference , and aggression . Animals were tested for aggression in their home cage , both with and without physical provocation ( mild tail pinch ) . Brain levels of 5 - HT and its metabolite , 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid ) , were determined using HPLC . PCPA significantly and substantially depleted 5 - HT and 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid in all brain regions examined . Chronic testosterone treatment significantly decreased 5 - HT and 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid in certain brain areas , but to a much lesser extent than PCPA . Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior , partner preference , or aggression . testosterone alone had no effect on locomotion , irritability , or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression . The most striking effect of combining testosterone + PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack , particularly following physical provocation . Based on these data , it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5 - HT may be especially prone to exhibit aggressive behavior ."}

PURPOSE : Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of ocular hypertension and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility . The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes . METHODS : The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow , variable pressure perfusion culture system . Paired eyes were perfused in serum - free media with or without 10 ( - 7 ) M dexamethasone for 12 days . Intraocular pressure was monitored daily . After incubation , the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy , transmission and scanning electron microscopy , and scanning laser confocal microscopy . RESULTS : A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with dexamethasone with an average pressure rise of 17 . 5 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg after 12 days of dexamethasone exposure . The contralateral control eyes , which did not receive dexamethasone , maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period . The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal . In contrast , the dexamethasone - treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams , decreased intertrabecular spaces , thickened juxtacanalicular tissue , activated trabecular meshwork cells , and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material , especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm . The dexamethasone - treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes , although several subtle dexamethasone - induced morphologic changes were evident . CONCLUSION : Dexamethasone treatment of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30 % of the dexamethasone - treated eyes . Steroid treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and open angle glaucoma . This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in steroid glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma ."}

In addition to its use as a stabilizer / rigidifier of membranes , cholesteryl hemisuccinate , tris salt ( CS ) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) . To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection , we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non - hydrolyzable ether form of CS , gamma - cholesteryloxybutyric acid , tris salt ( CSE ) against acetaminophen - , adriamycin - , carbon tetrachloride - , chloroform - and galactosamine - induced toxicity . The results of these studies demonstrated that CS - mediated protection is not selective for a particular species , organ system or toxic chemical . A 24 - h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS ( 100mg / kg , i . p . ) , resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4 , CHCl3 , acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal ( and presumably cardiotoxic ) effect of adriamycin administration . Maximal CS - mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult . These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death . The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate ( in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity ) . However , based on the data presented , we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation . Our findings do suggest that CS - mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule ( non - hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS ) , whose mechanism has yet to be defined ."}

METHODS : This comparative , Phase III , 12 - week , multicenter , prospective , randomized , double - blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II hypertension . Patients were treated with oral FDC of T + A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks ; blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position . Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP ( SBP ) / diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline to study end and number of responders ( ie , patients who achieved target SBP / DBP < 130 / < 80 mm Hg ) at end of study . Tolerability was assessed by treatment - emergent adverse events , identified using physical examination , laboratory analysis , and electrocardiography . RESULTS : A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study ; 203 patients ( 143 men , 60 women ) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow - up ( 4 patients in the T + A group and 3 in the A group ) and considered with - drawn .

PURPOSE : The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage - enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology ; however , myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use . Dexrazoxane ( ICRF - 187 ) is recommended for protection against anthracycline - induced cardiotoxicity . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Because of their widespread use , the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated : Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide , daunorubicin , and doxorubicin + / - dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte - macrophage colony forming assays . Likewise , in vivo , B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide , daunorubicin , and doxorubicin , with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses : posttreatment , a full hematologic evaluation was done . RESULTS : Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay ; however , dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression , weight loss , nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin . CONCLUSION : Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically , the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern ; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention . Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane . Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity .

The effect of aniracetam ( Ro 13 - 5057 , 1 - anisoyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone ) was studied on various forms of experimentally impaired cognitive functions ( learning and memory ) in rodents and produced the following effects : ( 1 ) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session ; ( 2 ) partial ( rats ) or complete ( mice ) prevention of the scopolamine - induced short - term amnesia for a passive avoidance task ; ( 3 ) complete protection against amnesia for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition ; ( 4 ) prevention of the long - term retention - or retrieval - deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by chloramphenicol or cycloheximide administered immediately after acquisition ; ( 5 ) reversal , when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test , of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by cycloheximide injected 2 days previously ; ( 6 ) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or hypercapnia applied immediately before retrieval testing ( 24 h after acquisition ) . These improvements or normalizations of impaired cognitive functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10 - 100 mg / kg . Generally , the dose - response curves were bell - shaped . The mechanisms underlying the activity of aniracetam and its ' therapeutic window ' are unknown . Piracetam , another pyrrolidinone derivative was used for comparison . It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one - tenth the potency of aniracetam . The results indicate that aniracetam improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process ."}

In the present study , effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated . Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose - dependent catalepsy . The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine . Intraperitoneal administration of atropine , naloxone , mecamylamine , and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine . Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine , hexamethonium , and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine . Intraperitoneal administration of atropine , but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium , decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine . It was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors , and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms ."}

PATIENTS AND METHODS : Two hundred ninety - seven patients with metastatic breast cancer and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg / m ( 2 ) of Myocet ( M ) or conventional doxorubicin ( A ) , in combination with 600 mg / m ( 2 ) of cyclophosphamide ( C ) , every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Cardiotoxicity was defined by reductions in left - ventricular ejection fraction , assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans , or congestive heart failure ( congestive heart failure ) . Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective tumor response rates ( World Health Organization criteria ) , time to progression , and survival . RESULTS : Six percent of MC patients versus 21 % ( including five cases of congestive heart failure ) of AC patients developed cardiotoxicity ( P = . 0002 ) . Median cumulative doxorubicin dose at onset was more than 2 , 220 mg / m ( 2 ) for MC versus 480 mg / m ( 2 ) for AC ( P = . 0001 , hazard ratio , 5 . 04 ) . MC patients also experienced less grade 4 neutropenia .

PURPOSE : To develop a model of visceral pain in rats using a behavioral approach . Cyclophosphamide ( Cyclophosphamide ) , an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite acrolein , was used to induce cystitis . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Cyclophosphamide was administered at doses of 50 , 100 and 200 mg . / kg . i . p . to male rats , and their behavior observed and scored . The effects of morphine ( 0 . 5 to 4 mg . / kg . i . v . ) on Cyclophosphamide - induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after naloxone ( 1 mg . / kg . s . c . ) . In addition , 90 minutes after Cyclophosphamide injection , that is , at the time of administration of morphine , the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination . Finally , to show that the bladder is essential for the Cyclophosphamide - induced behavioral modifications , female rats also received Cyclophosphamide at doses of 200 mg . / kg . i . p . and of 20 mg . by the intravesical route , and acrolein at doses of 0 . 5 mg . by the intravesical route and of 5 mg . / kg . i . v . RESULTS : Cyclophosphamide dose - relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats : breathing rate decrease , closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures . Morphine dose - dependently reversed these behavioral disorders . A dose of 0 . 5 mg . / kg . produced a reduction of almost 50 % of the behavioral score induced by Cyclophosphamide 200 mg . / kg . This effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with naloxone . At the time of administration of morphine , histological modifications of the bladder wall , such as chorionic and muscle layer edema , were observed . In female rats , Cyclophosphamide 200 mg . / kg . i . p . produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats .

SETTING : Three large urban hospitals ( with active cardiovascular surgery programs ) . PATIENTS : 14 patients seen over a 3 - year period in whom heparin - induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications . MEASUREMENTS : Platelet counts , onset of objectively determined thromboembolism , results of heparin - induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests , and outcomes . RESULTS : Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure - - in most cases , with no thrombocytopenia recognized - - only to return to the hospital ( median , day 14 ) with thromboembolic complications . Thromboemboli were venous ( 12 patients , 7 with pulmonary emboli ) or arterial ( 4 patients ) or both . Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation .

OBJECTIVE : To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin II antagonist , valsartan , with a reference therapy , amlodipine . METHODS : One hundred sixty - eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double - blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks . After 8 weeks of therapy , in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled , 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy . Patients were assessed at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks . The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks . Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates . RESULTS : Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks . Similar decreases were observed in both groups , with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed . For the primary variable the difference was 0 . 5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan ( p = 0 . 68 ; 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 7 to 1 . 7 ) . Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66 . 7 % for valsartan and 60 . 2 % for amlodipine ( p = 0 . 39 ) . Both treatments were well tolerated . The incidence of drug - related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group , particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day ( 2 . 4 % for 80 mg valsartan ; 3 . 6 % for 5 mg amlodipine ; 0 % for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine ; 14 . 3 % for 10 mg amlodipine ) . CONCLUSIONS : The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension .

METHODS : acetylsalicylic acid was administered as a single dose on GD 9 ( 0 , 250 , 500 , or 625 mg / kg ) , 10 ( 0 , 500 , 625 , or 750 mg / kg ) , or 11 ( 0 , 500 , 750 , or 1000 mg / kg ) and from GD 6 to GD 17 ( 0 , 50 , 125 , or 250 mg / kg a day ) in the multiple dose study to SD rats . Animals were killed on GD 21 , and fetuses were examined viscerally . RESULTS : The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects ( ventricular septal defects ) and midline defects ( midline defects ) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia ( diaphragmatic hernia ) , midline defects , and ventricular septal defects in rabbits ( Cook JC et al . , 2003 ) ; hence , the present study focused on these malformations , even though acetylsalicylic acid induces several other low - incidence malformations . In single dose studies , diaphragmatic hernia , MD , and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10 . VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11 . In contrast , diaphragmatic hernia and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group , and VSD was noted across all dose groups . CONCLUSIONS : High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats . Variations and malformations were similar when acetylsalicylic acid was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis ( GDs 6 to 17 ) . It was also evident that , by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose , malformations that normally occur at low incidence , as reported from previous single dose studies , could also be induced with acetylsalicylic acid given at multiple doses ."}

Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of Parkinson ' s disease . While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951 , the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson ' s disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study . A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off - periods even in patients with complex on - off motor swings . Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off - time by more than 50 % in this group of patients , which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add - on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors . Extended follow - up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long - term persistence of apomorphine efficacy . In addition , there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa - induced dyskinesias . The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems , whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role .

A common side effect associated with succinylcholine is postoperative myalgia . The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear ; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence . We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia . The incidence and severity of succinylcholine - associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine ( n = 32 for each ) . Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups : 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group , and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients , respectively ( not significant ) . At 48 h after surgery , 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia ( not significant ) . In addition , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline . We found an increase of IL - 6 for only three patients , but only one patient reported myalgia ; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL - 6 was found . In conclusion , there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine - associated myalgia .

Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air / oxygen only . After premedication with diazepam , glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia , and induction with standard doses of ketamine , a maintenance dose of 10 - 20 microg / kg / min of ketamine proved safe and effective . Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring , relying heavily on the heart rate . Diazepam , unless contraindicated or risky , remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations . Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia . An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h , glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects , especially in a hot climate .

{"document_id": "11860495", "title": "11860495", "text": "Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti - amnesic effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats . Pregnenolone sulphate ( Pregnenolone sulphate ) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory - enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies , with particular importance in the ageing process . The mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems . This hypothesis stems from findings that Pregnenolone sulphate is a potent positive modulator of N - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( NMDARs ) and a negative modulator of gamma - aminobutyric acid ( A ) receptors ( GABA ( A ) Rs ) . Moreover , Pregnenolone sulphate is able to reverse the amnesic - like effects of NMDAR and GABA ( A ) R ligands . To investigate this hypothesis , the present study in rats examined the memory - altering abilities of structural analogs of Pregnenolone sulphate , which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and / or GABA ( A ) R function . The analogs tested were : 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate ( an agent that is inactive at GABA ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) , epipregnanolone ( [ 3beta - hydroxy - 5beta - pregnan - 20 - one ] sulphate , an inhibitor of both GABA ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) , and a newly synthesized ( - ) Pregnenolone sulphate enantiomer ( which is identical to Pregnenolone sulphate in effects on GABA ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) . The memory - enhancing effects of Pregnenolone sulphate and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine - induced amnesia . Both Pregnenolone sulphate and its ( - ) enantiomer blocked the effects of scopolamine . The results show that , unlike Pregnenolone sulphate , 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine , suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory - enhancing effects of Pregnenolone sulphate . Moreover , enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural Pregnenolone sulphate to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine - induced amnesia . These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive steroids ."}

BACKGROUND : Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans , and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation . The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US , using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin - evoked mechanical hypersensitivity . METHODS : Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent , 65 volunteers were studied in two trials : an open - label , dose - escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0 . 25 - 2 . 0 mg and a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of adenosine , 2 mg . Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis , and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined . RESULTS : Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h . In contrast , residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short ( < 4 h ) . CONCLUSIONS : These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity , presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection . The long - lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid ."}

However , it is not certain as to the following : ( a ) what receptors were stimulated by the ACTH N - terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder ; ( b ) whether NE , released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo - cerebellar pathway , did indeed cause the long - term depression at Purkinje cell synapses ( previously described by others ) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder ; ( c ) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei , the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons , that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder . These questions are currently being investigated ."}

The highly - selective alpha - 2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine ( dexmedetomidine ) is capable of inducing muscle flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs . Intense generalized muscle rigidity is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists . Although the neurochemistry of opiate - induced rigidity has yet to be fully elucidated , recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism . In the present study , the authors determined if treatment with dexmedetomidine prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high - dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat . Animals ( n = 42 ) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens : 1 ) L - MED ( the inactive L - isomer of medetomidine ) , 30 micrograms / kg ; 2 ) dexmedetomidine , 10 micrograms / kg ; 3 ) dexmedetomidine , 30 micrograms / kg ; 4 ) dexmedetomidine [ 30 micrograms / kg ] and the central - acting alpha - 2 antagonist , idazoxan [ 10 mg / kg ] ; 5 ) dexmedetomidine [ 30 micrograms / kg ] and the peripheral - acting alpha - 2 antagonist DG - 5128 [ 10 mg / kg ] , or ; 6 ) saline . Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment . Each rat was then injected with alfentanil ( alfentanil , 0 . 5 mg / kg sc ) . alfentanil injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L - MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline . In contrast , dexmedetomidine prevented alfentanil - induced muscle rigidity in a dose - dependent fashion . The small EMG values obtained in the high - dose dexmedetomidine group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate . The high - dose dexmedetomidine animals were flaccid , akinetic , and lacked a startle response during the entire experimental period . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )"}

The effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2 - h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion ( middle cerebral artery occlusion ) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studied . Under isoflurane anesthesia , the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded . In the control group ( n = 7 ) , the mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) was not manipulated . In the hypertensive group ( n = 7 ) , the MAP was elevated by 25 - 30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion . Four hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion , the rats were killed and the brains harvested . The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion . Specific gravity ( SG ) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex ( core and periphery of the ischemic territory ) . The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium staining . In the ischemic core , there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups .

To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic , metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment . Chlorthalidone ( 50 mg daily ) was given for 14 days . Six patients received a normal - sodium diet and four a low - sodium ( 17 mmol / day ) diet . All patients had a normal initial total body potassium ( 40K ) . The electrolyte balances , weight , bromide space , plasma renin activity , and aldosterone secretion rate were measured . In both groups a potassium deficit developed , with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment . In the normal - sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9 , after which some potassium was regained ; in the low - sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13 . The normal - sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels ; in the low - sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elevated . It is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic - induced potassium loss , presumably by an increased activity of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion ."}

Oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension , particularly when given as a bolus . The resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return . Parturients with normal volume status , heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume . Oxytocin - induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss . Pulse power analysis ( also called \" pulse contour analysis \" ) of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time , thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure . Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia .

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways . VIP ( - / - ) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after cyclophosphamide ( cyclophosphamide ) - induced cystitis . Given VIP ' s role as an anti - inflammatory mediator , we hypothesized that VIP ( - / - ) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cystitis . A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type ( WT ) and VIP ( - / - ) mice with or without cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis ( 150 mg / kg ; i . p . ; 48 h ) . Four binary comparisons were made : WT control versus cyclophosphamide treatment ( 48 h ) , VIP ( - / - ) control versus cyclophosphamide treatment ( 48 h ) , WT control versus VIP ( - / - ) control , and WT with cyclophosphamide treatment ( 48 h ) versus VIP ( - / - ) with cyclophosphamide treatment ( 48 h ) . The genes presented represent ( 1 ) greater than 1 . 5 - fold change in either direction and ( 2 ) the p value is less than 0 . 05 for the comparison being made . Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme - linked immunoassays including IL - 1beta and CXCL1 . cyclophosphamide treatment significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) increased expression of CXCL1 and IL - 1beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP ( - / - ) mice , but expression in VIP ( - / - ) mice with cyclophosphamide treatment was significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) greater ( 4 . 2 - to 13 - fold increase ) than that observed in WT urinary bladder ( 3 . 6 - to 5 - fold increase ) . The data suggest that in VIP ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation , inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with cyclophosphamide . This shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in VIP ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways ."}

Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) by oxidant - mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress . Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin ( doxorubicin ) , a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic . Thus , we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity . Using a dual approach of PARP - 1 suppression , by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34 , we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by doxorubicin . PARP - 1 + / + and PARP - 1 - / - mice received a single injection of doxorubicin ( 25 mg / kg i . p ) . Five days after doxorubicin administration , left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP - 1 + / + mice , but only to a smaller extent in PARP - 1 - / - ones . Similar experiments were conducted in BALB / c mice treated with PJ34 or vehicle . Treatment with a PJ34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals . In addition PJ34 significantly reduced the doxorubicin - induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart . Thus , PARP activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin .

CASE SUMMARY : A 68 - year - old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed torsade de pointes eight days after commencing oral fluconazole The patient had no other risk factors for torsade de pointes , including coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy , congestive heart failure , and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of fluconazole and torsade de pointes . The torsade de pointes resolved when fluconazole was discontinued ; however , the patient continued to have premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ( nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION : Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of torsade de pointes . The possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents . In our patient , there was no other etiology identified that could explain QT prolongation or torsade de pointes The complete disappearance of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology . CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware that fluconazole , even at low doses , may cause prolongation of the QT interval , leading to torsade de pointes .

Increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model , one receiving 20 mg / kg b . w . of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia , the other receiving 650 micrograms / kg b . w . of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters / min intravenously during ischemia , although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly higher . The present data indicate that the determination of malondialdehyde , oxypurines , and nucleosides in peripheral blood , may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena .

We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54 - yr - old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens . When the androgens were withdrawn , the patient ' s physical changes , symptoms , sleep study , and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal . A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone . Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea . Our report provides direct evidence for this role . Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep . Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy ."}

Two other patients suffered from partial , complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication . Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure - free . Previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG . On the other hand , enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings ."}

The present study examines the effect of 6 - day epinephrine treatment ( 100 micrograms / kg per h , s . c . ) on stimulus - induced ( 1 Hz ) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle - and epinephrine - treated rats . Renal catecholamine stores and stimulus - induced overflow in the vehicle - treated group consisted of norepinephrine only . However , epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40 % of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was reduced by a similar degree . Total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged . Stimulus - induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine - treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidney . This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade . Propranolol had no effect on stimulus - induced overflow in either group . Phentolamine increased stimulus - induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine - treated group . In conclusion , chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow . However , neither alterations in prejunctional beta - adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration . Furthermore , data obtained with phentolamine alone do not suggest alpha - adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment ."}

Thirty - six of the 210 patients ( 17 . 2 % ) developed iridocyclitis . Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients ( 0 to 4 years ) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis . However , 30 % of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age . Although 61 % of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry , 42 % had active uveitis on entry . Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases . Forty - four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms , such as red eye , ocular pain , decreased visual acuity , or photophobia , in order of decreasing frequency . Even after early detection and prompt treatment , 41 % of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics . Despite this , there was a dramatic decrease in the 50 % incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies . Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13 % of our group , respectively . We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs . Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases ; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found . Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases . This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously . Surgical treatment of cataracts , band keratopathy , and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results ."}
